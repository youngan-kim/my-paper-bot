## 1. Assessing the Number of Criteria in GIS‐Based Multicriteria Evaluation: A Machine Learning Approach
- **Authors:** Lan Qing Zhao, S. Dragićević, Shivanand Balram, Liliana Perez
- **Journal:** Geographical Analysis
- **Date:** 2025-03-27
- **Abstract:** The analytical hierarchy process (AHP) is a widely used approach and a decision rule to derive criteria weights in geographic information system‐based multi‐criteria evaluation (GIS‐MCE). However, one limitation of the AHP method is that it constrains the number of criteria that can be meaningfully weighted to typically seven to nine criteria. Recently, machine learning (ML) techniques have emerged as a compelling alternative for deriving criteria weights. This research aims to assess the capabilities of ML‐MCE in handling a larger number of criteria and is specifically applied to a case study of urban suitability analysis. The random forest (RF) ML technique is used to evaluate the ability of the MCE method to handle up to 27 criteria. Geospatial data from the Metro Vancouver Region, Canada, are used, with the criteria subdivided into 11 groups starting with the most basic seven criteria and incrementally adding two new criteria per group. The results indicate the RF‐ML approach can manage a larger number of criteria compared to the traditional AHP approach, with 15 criteria providing a meaningful upper threshold, demonstrating its potential to accommodate a wider range of stakeholder preferences for complex urban suitability analysis contexts.

## 2. Introduction: Generating concepts of ‘the urban’ through comparative practice
- **Authors:** J. Robinson
- **Journal:** Urban studies
- **Date:** 2022-05-01
- **Abstract:** This Introduction to the special issue, ‘Comparative Methods for Global Urban Studies’, outlines the basis for a reformatted comparative method inspired by the complex spatialities of the urban world. The articles in the volume each bring forward innovative approaches to comparative methods which support wider conceptualisations of urban processes and urban experiences. The articles in this volume consider a wide range of urban contexts and collectively move beyond geopolitically imprecise propositions of ‘southern’ urbanism to embrace the wider comparative agenda of thinking with both the diversity and the profound interconnectedness of the urban globally. The articles contribute to decentring urban studies, opening conceptualisation to a range of different contexts and differently positioned writers. They also speak to the analytical and methodological challenges posed by current trends in global urbanisation, as dispersed, fragmented and extending over vast territories. Thinking with the multiple elsewheres of any urban context invites a comparative imagination – this introduction draws together the creative ways in which authors in this volume have responded to this potential. Processes of conceptualisation both emerge from and more acutely reveal the spatiality and nature of the global urban: comparative method, then, also proposes a certain mode of theorisation of the urban.

## 3. How Populist are Parties? Measuring Degrees of Populism in Party Manifestos Using Supervised Machine Learning
- **Authors:** Jessica Di Cocco, Bernardo Monechi
- **Journal:** Political Analysis
- **Date:** 2021-10-15
- **Abstract:** Abstract One of the main challenges in comparative studies on populism concerns its temporal and spatial measurements within and between a large number of parties and countries. Textual analysis has proved useful for these purposes, and automated methods can further improve research in this direction. Here, we propose a method to derive a score of parties’ levels of populism using supervised machine learning to perform textual analysis on national manifestos. We illustrate the advantages of our approach, which allows for measuring populism for a vast number of parties and countries without resource-intensive human-coding processes and provides accurate, updated information for temporal and spatial comparisons of populism. Furthermore, our method allows for obtaining a continuous score of populism, which ensures more fine-grained analyses of the party landscape while reducing the risk of arbitrary classifications. To illustrate the potential contribution of this score, we use it as a proxy for parties’ levels of populism, analyzing average trends in six European countries from the early 2000s for nearly two decades.

## 4. A posteriori comparisons, repeated instances and urban policy mobilities: What ‘best practices’ leave behind
- **Authors:** Sergio Montero, Gianpaolo Baiocchi
- **Journal:** Urban studies
- **Date:** 2021-09-06
- **Abstract:** Urban studies scholars have engaged in a lively debate on how to reformat comparative methods in the face of critical scrutiny of the discipline’s purported universalism. We share the enthusiasm for a reformatted urban comparativism and, in this paper, we turn to the thorny and more pragmatic question of how to actually carry it out. While traditional comparisons in urban studies have sought to find variation among similar cases by selecting a priori, in this article we propose to compare the findings of different researchers through a posteriori, that is, after the research has been done. We also argue that urban researchers need to focus on urban processes rather than cities; on repeated instances rather than on controlling for difference; and on mid-level abstraction rather than on grand theory or descriptive empirical cases. We put this strategy to work by comparing empirical research previously carried out by the authors on how two Latin American cities became international urban ‘best practices’: Bogotá as a sustainable transport model and Porto Alegre as a model of local participatory budgeting. The comparison highlights the tension between the simplified policy narratives that were mobilised to circulate Bogotá and Porto Alegre as international ‘best practices’ and the broader multi-scalar institutional reforms that these ‘best practice’ narratives have left behind in their global circulations. In doing so, we show the potential of a posteriori comparisons to analyse contemporary global urban dynamics and provide some explicit methodological tactics on how to do comparisons in a more systematic way.

## 5. Urban statecraft: The governance of transport infrastructures in African cities
- **Authors:** L. Cirolia, J. Harber
- **Journal:** Urban studies
- **Date:** 2021-08-21
- **Abstract:** Through the lens of infrastructure governance, this article explores the configurations and operations of the urban state in sub-Saharan Africa. We deploy and extend the concept of ‘statecraft’, drawing on the recent scholarship within urban studies which explores city and municipal statecraft. Consolidating insights across several studies on transport governance in African cities, we identify three ‘sites’ of urban statecraft evident in urban Africa. First, we look at sectoral authorities, which we analyse through the common experience of ringfenced national road agencies. Carving off urban functions can fragment power over urban infrastructure. Second, we look at metropolitan authorities, which we analyse through bus rapid transit (BRT) agencies. Metropolitanisation crafts new scales of governance in Africa’s larger cities. Finally, we turn to the regulation of informal service delivery systems, which we analyse through popular transport regulation. The regulation of minibus and motorcycle taxis shows the central importance of everyday practice in urban statecraft in Africa. The case of transport governance provides a particularly vivid display of the institutional fragmentation that exists between state agencies and institutions in African cities. In this context, the urban state is not a static municipal entity, but is enacted through complex and multi-scalar relationships. These relationships relate not only to the assignment of functions or territorial design, but also to the practices which animate infrastructural systems. More generally, we argue that there is ample scope within the African urban governance debates for deeper interrogation of statecraft.

## 6. City size and housing purchase intention: Evidence from rural–urban migrants in China
- **Authors:** Yanjiao Song, Chuanyong Zhang
- **Journal:** Urban studies
- **Date:** 2020-07-01
- **Abstract:** Despite the increased focus on housing choices among rural–urban migrants in China, there is a lack of studies on city size and housing purchase preferences. In this paper, we extend the conceptual framework of the Rosen–Roback model to analyse how city size affects rural–urban migrants’ housing purchase intention, and find that the impact of city size on the willingness to buy a house in the host city for migrants has an inverted U shape by using the China Migrants Dynamic Survey of 2014. To explain this phenomenon, we further adopt the Oaxaca–Blinder decomposition, which shows that rural–urban migrants have achieved a spatial equilibrium between housing costs and city amenities in large cities, compared with megacities and small cities. Specifically, the amenities in large cities can compensate for the negative impact of the high housing cost, making these large cities more attractive than small ones for rural–urban migrants, while rural migrants have to bear high housing prices and exclusive urban welfare because of the strict household registration system in megacities. This study thus sheds new light on the adoption of diversified housing policies to solve the housing problems of rural–urban migrants in China by considering city size.

## 7. Micro-Scale, Meso-Scale, Macro-Scale, and Temporal Scale: Comparing the Relative Importance for Robbery Risk in New York City
- **Authors:** John R. Hipp, Young-An Kim, James C. Wo
- **Journal:** Justice quarterly
- **Date:** 2020-01-28
- **Abstract:** Abstract We compare the relative importance of four dimensions for explaining the micro location of robberies: 1) the micro spatial scale of street segments; 2) the meso spatial scale surrounding the street segment; 3) the temporal pattern, and 4) the macro-scale of the surrounding 2.5 miles. This study uses crime, business, and land use data from New York City and aggregates it to street segments and hours of the day. Although the measures capturing the micro-scale of the street segment explained the largest amount of unique variance, the measures capturing temporal scale across hours of the day (and weekdays) explained the next largest amount of unique variance. The measures of the characteristics in the 2.5 miles macro scale explained the next largest amount of unique variance, and combined with the measures at the meso-scale explained nearly as much of the variance as the street segment measures.

## 8. Gentrification, Land Use, and Crime
- **Authors:** J. Macdonald, R. Stokes
- **Journal:** annual review of criminology
- **Date:** 2020-01-13
- **Abstract:** Over the past twenty years, many US cities have seen urban revitalization and population changes associated with an increased desire for urban living among the affluent. As inner-city neighborhoods become gentrified, they are more likely to witness the construction of new buildings and homes, the conversion of industrial spaces to mixed-used developments, expanded access to mass transit, and the arrival of coffee shops and other urban amenities. In this review, we take stock of what is known about the impact of gentrification and land-use changes on neighborhood crime. We summarize research conducted since the period of urban revitalization that started in the 1990s as well as studies that have a quasi-experimental design. We find that gentrification and associated changes to land use tend to reduce crime in neighborhoods. Our findings are tempered by the need for greater conceptual clarity on how to measure when a neighborhood has gentrified and a clearer examination of the spatial displacement of crime. We conclude with a discussion on the need for criminologists to partner with urban planners to study how changes in the land use of cities can be made to generate crime reductions that benefit all places and, finally, detail some promising directions for future research.

## 9. Assessing the Spatial Concentration of Urban Crime: An Insight from Nigeria
- **Authors:** F. Umar, Shane D. Johnson, J. Cheshire
- **Journal:** Journal of quantitative criminology
- **Date:** 2020-01-06
- **Abstract:** Research demonstrates that crime is concentrated. This finding is so consistent that David Weisburd refers to this as the “law of crime concentration at place”. However, most research on crime concentration has been conducted in the US or European cities and has used secondary data sources. In this study, we examine whether the law of crime concentration applies in the context of sub-Saharan Africa using primary data. A crime victimization survey was used to collect data in the city of Kaduna (Nigeria). Using these data, the concentration of crime (breaking-and-entering and domestic theft) was examined at the household, street segment, and neighborhood levels. Specifically, variants of a Lorenz curve and the Gini index (GI) were used to examine whether crime concentrates at these different spatial scales and if such concentration reflects anything beyond the spatial distribution of opportunity for these types of offenses. Crime was found to concentrate at all spatial scales, and having accounted for expectation, given the distribution of opportunity, crime was most concentrated at the household level, closely followed by street segments. It was relatively less concentrated at the neighborhood level. The current study extends previous research in a number of ways. It shows that the law of crime concentration at place applies in a very different context to most previous work. Unlike previous studies, we use primary data collected specifically to test the law, avoiding problems associated with the dark figure of crime. Moreover, the findings persist after accounting for crime opportunity.

## 10. Broken Windows, Informal Social Control, and Crime: Assessing Causality in Empirical Studies.
- **Authors:** Charles C. Lanfear, R. Matsueda, L. Beach
- **Journal:** annual review of criminology
- **Date:** 2020-01-01
- **Abstract:** An important criminological controversy concerns the proper causal relationships between disorder, informal social control, and crime. The broken windows thesis posits that neighborhood disorder increases crime directly and indirectly by undermining neighborhood informal social control. Theories of collective efficacy argue that the association between neighborhood disorder and crime is spurious because of the confounding variable informal social control. We review the recent empirical research on this question, which uses disparate methods, including field experiments and different models for observational data. To evaluate the causal claims made in these studies, we use a potential outcomes framework of causality. We conclude that, although there is some evidence for both broken windows and informal control theories, there is little consensus in the present research literature. Furthermore, at present, most studies do not establish causality in a strong way.

## 11. Disambiguating the southern urban critique: Propositions, pathways and possibilities for a more global urban studies
- **Authors:** M. Lawhon, Yaffa Truelove
- **Journal:** Urban studies
- **Date:** 2020-01-01
- **Abstract:** Scholarship engaging with (northern) urban theory from the south has troubled the core of urban studies. At this critical juncture, we argue that it is important to clarify core propositions and call attention to points of convergence and dissonance amongst advocates of ‘the southern urban critique’. We briefly review foundational arguments for this scholarly community, then outline three distinct iterations of the source of this critique: the south is empirically different; EuroAmerican hegemony works to displace a diversity of intellectual traditions; and the postcolonial encounter requires the critical interrogation of research practices. We then consider whether the southern urban critique is an argument for the study of a distinct southern urbanism, an ontological position about the socio-spatial contingency of all theorisation or a tactical strategy for calling attention to marginalised places and ideas to be superseded by an urban studies of a world of cities. We hope our efforts contribute to further conversation and greater analytical clarity, enabling more rigorous and robust articulations of the precise objects and objectives of the southern urban critique in particular, and urban studies more generally.

## 12. Can Terrorism Abroad Influence Migration Attitudes at Home?
- **Authors:** Tobias Böhmelt, V. Bove, Enzo Nussio
- **Journal:** American Journal of Political Science
- **Date:** 2019-12-02
- **Abstract:** This article demonstrates that public opinion on migration “at home” is systematically driven by terrorism in other countries. Although there is little substantive evidence linking refugees or migrants to most recent terror attacks in Europe, news about terrorist attacks can trigger more negative views of immigrants. However, the spatial dynamics of this process are neglected in existing research. We argue that feelings of imminent danger and a more salient perception of migration threats do not stop at national borders. The empirical results based on spatial econometrics and data on all terrorist attacks in Europe for the post-9/11 period support these claims. The effect of terrorism on migration concern is strongly present within a country, but also diffuses across states in Europe. This finding improves our understanding of public opinion on migration, spill-over effects of terrorism, and it highlights crucial lessons for scholars interested in the security implications of population movements.

## 15. Settlement scaling theory: Bridging the study of ancient and contemporary urban systems
- **Authors:** J. Lobo, L. Bettencourt, Michael E. Smith, S. Ortman
- **Journal:** Urban studies
- **Date:** 2019-05-26
- **Abstract:** A general explanatory framework for the social processes underpinning urbanisation should account for empirical regularities that are shared among contemporary urban systems and ancient settlement systems known throughout archaeology and history. The identification of such shared properties has been facilitated by research traditions in each field that define cities and settlements as areas that capture networks of social interaction embedded in space. Using Settlement Scaling Theory (SST) – a set of hypotheses and mathematical relationships that together generate predictions for how measurable quantitative attributes of settlements are related to their population size – we show that aggregate properties of ancient settlement systems and contemporary metropolitan systems scale up in similar ways across time, geography and culture. Settlement scaling theory thus provides a unified framework for understanding and predicting these regularities across time and space, and for identifying putative processes common to all human settlements.

## 16. Making a place for space: Using spatial econometrics to model neighborhood effects
- **Authors:** Christoph Zangger
- **Journal:** Journal of Urban Affairs
- **Date:** 2019-05-17
- **Abstract:** ABSTRACT Researchers interested in neighborhood effects face many methodological challenges, including, among others, the unobserved selection into neighborhoods that might be associated with the outcome under study, the identification of endogenous effects, or the dependence of results on a neighborhood’s spatial scale. However, another issue has received little attention. Though theoretical explanations commonly stress the interdependence of individual actions in neighborhoods and the spatial diffusion processes between neighbors, the quantitative methods used to evaluate these approaches usually do not directly model such spillover and multiplier effects from one observation to another. Instead, they control for the resulting spatial correlation; for example, by means of multilevel models. Using spatial weights matrices that reflect the extent to which individual neighbors mutually influence each other, this article demonstrates how spatial econometrics are a means for the simultaneous modeling of different mechanisms of neighborhood effects. It further demonstrates how spatial Durbin models reproduce results from multilevel and instrumental variable models without the need to rely on aggregated characteristics of predefined neighborhoods.

## 17. Busy Businesses and Busy Contexts: The Distribution and Sources of Crime at Commercial Properties
- **Authors:** Marie Skubak Tillyer, Rebecca J. Walter
- **Journal:** Journal of research in crime and delinquency
- **Date:** 2019-05-12
- **Abstract:** Objective: Examine the distribution and sources of crime across freestanding businesses in San Antonio. We test hypotheses about the main and interactive effects of neighborhood and business characteristics on crime at the business, with a focus on busy contexts and busy businesses. Method: Police crime incident data are spatially joined to study area business parcels. Additional data sources include Infogroup USA Business Data, the American Community Survey, and an Environmental Protection Agency traffic activity indicator. Multilevel negative binomial regression models are estimated to observe the main and interactive effects of census block group and business variables on crime at the parcel. Results: Businesses located in block groups with more commercial property and high levels of vehicular traffic experience more crime. In addition, crime is higher at “busy” businesses, as indicated by employee size, sales volume, and square footage. Busy contexts and busy businesses do not appear to interact to increase crime at the parcel beyond their main effects. Conclusions: Crime is clustered at relatively few businesses, and this variation cannot be explained by business type alone. Both neighborhood and business characteristics are associated with crime at freestanding businesses, with busy businesses and those within busier block groups experiencing more crime.

## 18. Housing, urban growth and inequalities: The limits to deregulation and upzoning in reducing economic and spatial inequality
- **Authors:** A. Rodríguez‐Pose, M. Storper
- **Journal:** Urban studies
- **Date:** 2019-05-01
- **Abstract:** Urban economics and branches of mainstream economics – what we call the ‘housing as opportunity’ school of thought – have been arguing that shortages of affordable housing in dense agglomerations represent a fundamental barrier to economic development. Housing shortages are considered to limit migration into thriving cities, curtailing their expansion potential, generating rising social and spatial inequalities and inhibiting national growth. According to this dominant view, relaxing zoning and other planning regulations in the most prosperous cities is crucial to unleash the economic potential of cities and nations and to facilitate within-country migration. In this article, we contend that the bulk of the claims of the housing as opportunity approach are fundamentally flawed and lead to simplistic and misguided policy recommendations. We posit that there is no clear and uncontroversial evidence that housing regulation is a principal source of differences in home availability or prices across cities. Blanket changes in zoning are unlikely to increase domestic migration or to improve affordability for lower-income households in prosperous areas. They would, however, increase gentrification within metropolitan areas and would not appreciably decrease income inequality. In contrast to the housing models, we argue that the basic motors of all these features of the economy are the current geography of employment, wages and skills.

## 19. Network Spillovers and Neighborhood Crime: A Computational Statistics Analysis of Employment-Based Networks of Neighborhoods
- **Authors:** C. Graif, Brittany N. Freelin, Yu-Hsuan Kuo, Hongjian Wang, Z. Li, Daniel Kifer
- **Journal:** Justice quarterly
- **Date:** 2019-04-26
- **Abstract:** Abstract Research on communities and crime has predominantly focused on social conditions within an area or in its immediate proximity. However, a growing body of research shows that people often travel to areas away from home, contributing to connections between places. A few studies highlight the criminological implications of such connections, focusing on important but rare ties like co-offending or gang conflicts. The current study extends this idea by analyzing more common ties based on commuting across Chicago communities. It integrates standard criminological methods with machine learning and computational statistics approaches to investigate the extent to which neighborhood crime depends on the disadvantage of areas connected to it through commuting. The findings suggest that connected communities can influence each other from a distance and that connectivity to less disadvantaged work hubs may decrease local crime – with implications for advancing knowledge on the relational ecology of crime, social isolation, and ecological networks.

## 20. The Sensitivity of Spatial Regression Models to Network Misspecification
- **Authors:** Sebastian Juhl
- **Journal:** Political Analysis
- **Date:** 2019-03-25
- **Abstract:** Spatial econometric models become increasingly popular in various subfields of political science. However, the necessity to specify the underlying network of dependencies, denoted by $\boldsymbol{W}$ , prior to estimation is a prevalent source of criticism since the true dependence structure is rarely known and theories mostly provide insufficient guidance. The present study investigates the effects of this network uncertainty which is a special case of model uncertainty that arises from uncertainty about the correct specification of $\boldsymbol{W}$ . It advocates Bayesian model averaging (BMA) as a superior approach to this problem, located at the intersection of theory and empirics. Conducting Monte Carlo experiments, I demonstrate that, while the effect estimates are robust toward a misspecification in the functional form of $\boldsymbol{W}$ , uncertainty in the neighborhood definition can bias the effect estimates derived from spatial autoregressive models. In contrast to alternative techniques, BMA directly addresses network uncertainty, correctly identifies the true network structure in the set of feasible alternatives, and provides unbiased effect estimates. Two replication studies from different subfields of the discipline illustrate the benefits of this approach for applied research.
