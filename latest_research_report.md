- **Abstract:** Freshwater ecosystems are increasingly facing major global and local stressors, while monitoring surface water status by regulatory agencies is often limited by financial and political constraints. Citizen science–based approaches with robust quality control and training can support regulatory monitoring and decision-making. Herein, we outline the criteria used to develop a citizen science monitoring program for water quality, based on a standardized methodology designed to support the Agenda 2030 indicator 6.3.2 and the EU’s Water Framework Directive. We explore the evolution of protocols used to ensure data robustness and transferability and examine the utility of contextual information registered by citizen scientists. We present laboratory and field experiments conducted to validate chemical and optical methods. Using the data from more than 80 projects across 4 biogeographical regions, we explore consistencies and differences in seasonal and spatial trends in macronutrient concentrations between regions. Our results indicate that nitrate and phosphate concentrations tend to increase in areas with agricultural intensification and industrial land use. Seasonally, nitrate concentrations reach a maximum in spring and autumn in temperate regions, while phosphate levels are highest in summer and autumn, reaching a minimum in winter. We also found that observations of algal blooms coincided with periods of lower nitrate concentrations. Importantly, data of ecological, chemical, and optical conditions recorded by citizen scientists are being used by local and regional stakeholders in managing freshwater ecosystems. This study reveals the potential for scaling citizen science–based monitoring programs to contribute towards a global assessment of water quality.

- **Abstract:** Water hyacinth (Pontederia crassipes) is an invasive weed that covers a significant portion of Lake Tana. The infestation has an impact on the lake’s ecological and socioeconomic systems. Early detection of the spread of water hyacinth using geospatial techniques is crucial for its effective management and control. The main objective of this study was to examine the spatiotemporal distribution of water hyacinth from 2016 to 2022 using a random forest machine learning model. The study used 16 variables obtained from Sentinel-2A, Sentinel-1 SAR, and SRTM DEM, and a random forest supervised classification model was applied. Seven spectral indices, five spectral bands, two Sentinel-1 SAR bands, and two topographic variables were used in combination to model the spatial distribution of water hyacinth. The model was evaluated using the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient. The findings demonstrated that the overall accuracy ranged from 0.91 to 0.94 and kappa coefficient from 0.88 to 0.92 in the wet season and 0.93 to 0.95 and 0.90 to 0.93 in the dry season, respectively. B11 and B5 (2022), VH, soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), and normalized difference water index (NDWI) (2020), B5 and B12 (2018), and VH and slope (2016) are the highly important variables in the classification. The study found that the spatial coverage of water hyacinth was 686.5 and 650.4 ha (2016), 1,851 and 1,259 ha (2018), 1,396.7 and 1,305.7 ha (2020), and 1,436.5 and 1,216.5 ha (2022) in the wet and dry seasons, respectively. The research findings indicate that variables derived from optical (Sentinel-2A and SRTM) and non-optical (Sentinel-1 SAR) satellite imagery effectively identify water hyacinth and display its spatiotemporal spread using the random forest machine learning algorithm.

## 8. [Milling Machine Fault Diagnosis Using Acoustic Emission and Hybrid Deep Learning with Feature Optimization](https://doi.org/10.3390/app142210404)

- **DOI:** [10.3390/app142210404](https://doi.org/10.3390/app142210404)
- **Abstract:** This paper presents a fault diagnosis technique for milling machines based on acoustic emission (AE) signals and a hybrid deep learning model optimized with a genetic algorithm. Mechanical failures in milling machines, particularly in critical components like cutting tools, gears, and bearings, account for a significant portion of operational breakdowns, leading to unplanned downtime and financial losses. To address this issue, the proposed method first acquires AE signals from the milling machine. AE signals, capturing the dynamic responses of machine components, are transformed into continuous wavelet transform (CWT) scalograms for further analysis. Gaussian filtering is applied to enhance the clarity of these scalograms, effectively reducing noise while maintaining essential features. A convolutional neural network (CNN) based on the VGG16 architecture is utilized for spatial feature extraction, followed by a bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) network to capture the temporal dependencies of the scalograms. The genetic algorithm (GA) is used to optimize feature selection and ensure the selection of the most relevant features to further improve the model’s performance. The optimized features are finally fed into a fully connected (FC) layer of the proposed hybrid model for fault classification. The proposed method achieves an accuracy of 99.6%, significantly outperforming traditional approaches. This method offers a highly accurate and efficient solution for fault detection in milling machines, allowing for more reliable predictive maintenance and operational efficiency in industrial settings.

## 10. [Spatial Economics](https://doi.org/10.14530/se)
- **Authors:** Stephen J. Redding
- **Journal:** Social Science Research Network
- **Date:** 2024-11-01
- **DOI:** [10.14530/se](https://doi.org/10.14530/se)
- **Abstract:** This paper reviews recent research in spatial economics. The field of spatial economics is concerned with the determinants and effects of the location of economic activity in geographic space. It analyses how geographical location shapes the economic activities performed by agents, their interactions with one another, their welfare, and the effects of public policy interventions. Research in this area has benefited from the simultaneous development of new theoretical techniques, new sources of geographic information systems (GIS) data, rapid advances in computing power, machine learning and artificial intelligence, and renewed public policy interest in infrastructure and appropriate policies towards places “left-behind” by globalization and technology. Among the insights from this research are the role of goods and commuting market access in determining location choices; the conditions under which the location of economic activity is characterized by multiple equilibria; the circumstances under which temporary shocks can have permanent effects (hysteresis or path dependence); the heterogeneous and persistent impact of local shocks; the magnitude and spatial decay of agglomeration economics; and the role of both agglomeration forces and endogenous changes in land use in shaping the impact of transport infrastructure improvements.

- **Abstract:** Abstract Building upon prior work, we propose an alternative way to look at the pattern of spatial crime concentration and temporal stability of it. We first identify a high-crime cluster using the sample block groups in New York City by employing a k-means clustering method. We then examine the temporal stability of the high-crime cluster over time. We also longitudinally assess how our high-crime cluster classification is associated with the actual amount of crime while accounting for the measures of social and physical environments. We observed that about 6–12% of total areas are identified to be in the high-crime cluster. We also found that block groups identified to be high-crime cluster in one year are more likely to be that way in the next year. We hope future research may consider using data-driven approaches to expand understanding of spatial and temporal crime patterns.

## 13. [The Universal Neighborhood Effect Averaging in Mobility-Dependent Environmental Exposures](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.4c02464)

- **Date:** 2024-10-03
- **DOI:** [10.1021/acs.est.4c02464](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.4c02464)
- **Abstract:** The neighborhood effect averaging problem (NEAP) is a fundamental statistical phenomenon in mobility-dependent environmental exposures. It suggests that individual environmental exposures tend toward the average exposure in the study area when considering human mobility. However, the universality of the NEAP across various environmental exposures and the mechanisms underlying its occurrence remain unclear. Here, using a large human mobility data set of more than 27 000 individuals in the Chicago Metropolitan Area, we provide robust evidence of the existence of the NEAP in a range of individual environmental exposures, including green spaces, air pollution, healthy food environments, transit accessibility, and crime rates. We also unveil the social and spatial disparities in the NEAP’s influence on individual environmental exposure estimates. To further reveal the mechanisms behind the NEAP, we perform multiscenario analyses based on environmental variation and human mobility simulations. The results reveal that the NEAP is a statistical phenomenon of regression to the mean (RTM) under the constraints of spatial autocorrelation in environmental data. Increasing travel distances and out-of-home durations can intensify and promote the NEAP’s impact, particularly for highly dynamic environmental factors like air pollution. These findings illuminate the complex interplay between human mobility and environmental factors, guiding more effective public health interventions.

## 15. [Mixed-use urban land parcels identification integrating geospatial data and machine learning](https://doi.org/10.1080/10095020.2024.2374996)

- **DOI:** [10.1080/10095020.2024.2374996](https://doi.org/10.1080/10095020.2024.2374996)
- **Abstract:** ABSTRACT Urban land use information is essential for urban planning and sustainable development. However, the increasing prevalence of Mixed-Use Urban Land (MUUL) introduces uncertainty in land use mapping. Due to the compatibility of different human activities within MUUL, identifying MUUL is still a challenge for scholars. In this study, we proposed a novel framework by integrating geographic big data and machine learning to identify it. First, to be consistent with urban planning practices, we delineated mapping units from urban planning map. Second, based on the variability of the spatial pattern of POIs, two indices, the Amount of POI (AP) and the Deviation Index (DI), were developed. Finally, the random forest model was employed. The empirical study in the Jianghan District of Wuhan, China, showed that the MUUL and non-MUUL exhibited significant spatial pattern of POIs separability, the average AP and DI of the MUUL were much larger than those of the non-MUUL. Moreover, the relatively high identification accuracy (Kappa Coefficient (KC) = 0.85, Hellden’s Mean Accuracy (MA) = 0.87) further demonstrated the effectiveness of the developed indices. The proposed framework in this study can reduce the adverse impacts of MUUL on urban land identification by avoiding the MUUL from being incorrectly identified as a single function. Moreover, by extracting MUUL in advance, it can improve the research efficiency by avoiding the application of the segmentation algorithm to all mapping units as in the previous study. Overall, this study provides important references for scholars to increase the accuracy of urban land use identification and allows authorities and policymakers to monitor the dynamics of MUUL that are essential to urban vibrancy. The spatial pattern indices proposed in this study can also be applied to urban land use identification studies as important features.

- **Abstract:** In the era of rapid advancements in artificial intelligence, the geospatial field is experiencing transformative changes. Traditional methods for land cover classification and anomaly detection have often been inconsistent and inaccurate, leading to significant real-world issues such as resource misallocation, unnoticed illegal activities like deforestation, unmonitored topographical changes such as unauthorized constructions, unattended forest fires, and border fence crises, all of which exacerbate climate change and urbanization challenges. This study systematically explores various machine learning (ML) techniques and their application to publicly available geospatial datasets. Specifically, it compares selected Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and other ML models on these datasets to evaluate multiple performance metrics and conduct a comparative analysis. While numerous ML models have been previously employed for land cover classification and anomaly detection, this review seeks to enhance performance metrics and improve classification accuracy. Prior studies have employed techniques such as Random Forest on Sentinel-2 data (Gromny et al., 2019), multiple regression approaches on Landsat data (Wu et al., 2016), and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on OpenStreetMap data (Feldmeyer et al., 2020). Our study introduces the application of advanced models like VGG16, UNet, and Isolation Forest to geospatial datasets, assessing their impact on enhancing land cover classification and anomaly detection. This research not only aims to achieve higher classification accuracy but also contributes to the field by providing insights into the effectiveness of these models and proposing future directions and opportunities.

- **Abstract:** Land degradation from gully erosion poses a significant threat to the Erer watershed in Eastern Ethiopia, particularly due to agricultural activities and resource exploitation. Identifying erosion-prone areas and underlying factors using advanced machine learning algorithms (MLAs) and geospatial analysis is crucial for addressing this problem and prioritizing adaptive and mitigating strategies. However, previous studies have not leveraged machine learning (ML) and GIS-based approaches to generate susceptibility maps identifying these areas and conditioning factors, hindering sustainable watershed management solutions. This study aimed to predict gully erosion susceptibility (GES) and identify underlying areas and factors in the Erer watershed. Four ML models, namely, XGBoost, random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and artificial neural network (ANN), were integrated with geospatial analysis using 22 geoenvironmental predictors and 1,200 inventory points (70% used for training and 30% for testing). Model performance and robustness were validated through the area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, kappa coefficient, F1 score, and logarithmic loss. The relative slope position is most influential, with 100% importance in SVM and RF and 95% importance in XGBoost, while annual rainfall (AR) dominated ANN (100% importance). Notably, XGBoost demonstrated robustness and superior prediction/mapping, achieving an AUC of 0.97, 91% accuracy, 92% precision, and 81% kappa while maintaining a low logloss (0.0394). However, SVM excelled in classifying gully resistant/susceptible areas (97% sensitivity, 98% specificity, and 91% F1 score). The ANN model predicted the most areas with very high gully susceptibility (13.74%), followed by the SVM (11.69%), XGBoost (10.65%), and RF (7.85%) models, while XGBoost identified the most areas with very low susceptibility (70.19%). The ensemble technique was employed to further enhance GES modeling, and it outperformed the individual models, achieving an AUC of 0.99, 93.5% accuracy, 92.5% precision, 97.5% sensitivity, 95.4% specificity, 85.8% kappa, and 94.9% F1 score. This technique also classified the GES of the watershed as 36.48% very low, 26.51% low, 16.24% moderate, 11.55% high, and 9.22% very high. Furthermore, district-level analyses revealed the most susceptible areas, including the Babile, Fedis, Harar, and Meyumuluke districts, with high GES areas of 32.4%, 21.3%, 14.3%, and 13.6%, respectively. This study offers robust and flexible ML models with comprehensive validation metrics to enhance GES modeling and identify gully prone areas and factors, thereby supporting decision-making for sustainable watershed conservation and land degradation prevention.

- **Abstract:** Assessing and understanding the urban scale impacts of extreme climate events is a global necessity. Risks associated with heat, where intra-urban dynamics and rural/urban boundary conditions greatly impact its distribution, are of particular interest as the evolution of climate change and ur-banization persists. Characterizing Urban Heat Island (UHI) effects is dependent on the availability of high-resolution near-surface air temperature maps and a description of the Local Climate Zones (LCZs). This study assesses the applicability of state-of-the-art (SOTA) Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques for UHI detection and characterization. A Geospatial Foundation Model (GFM) is fine-tuned to predict 2 m air temperature at a 1 km resolution for the urban areas of Johannesburg, South Africa, with mean absolute error measures less than 1.5 °C. UHI characterization is further enabled through a Fully Connected Network (FCN) model for LCZs classification for the same region of interest.

- **Abstract:** Flooding is a major natural hazard worldwide, causing catastrophic damage to communities and infrastructure. Due to climate change exacerbating extreme weather events robust flood hazard modeling is crucial to support disaster resilience and adaptation. This study uses multi-sourced geospatial datasets to develop an advanced machine learning framework for flood hazard assessment in the Arambag region of West Bengal, India. The flood inventory was constructed through Sentinel-1 SAR analysis and global flood databases. Fifteen flood conditioning factors related to topography, land cover, soil, rainfall, proximity, and demographics were incorporated. Rigorous training and testing of diverse machine learning models, including RF, AdaBoost, rFerns, XGB, DeepBoost, GBM, SDA, BAM, monmlp, and MARS algorithms, were undertaken for categorical flood hazard mapping. Model optimization was achieved through statistical feature selection techniques. Accuracy metrics and advanced model interpretability methods like SHAP and Boruta were implemented to evaluate predictive performance. According to the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), the prediction accuracy of the models performed was around > 80%. RF achieves an AUC of 0.847 at resampling factor 5, indicating strong discriminative performance. AdaBoost also consistently exhibits good discriminative ability, with AUC values of 0.839 at resampling factor 10. Boruta and SHAP analysis indicated precipitation and elevation as factors most significantly contributing to flood hazard assessment in the study area. Most of the machine learning models pointed out southern portions of the study area as highly susceptible areas. On average, from 17.2 to 18.6% of the study area is highly susceptible to flood hazards. In the feature selection analysis, various nature-inspired algorithms identified the selected input parameters for flood hazard assessment, i.e., elevation, precipitation, distance to rivers, TWI, geomorphology, lithology, TRI, slope, soil type, curvature, NDVI, distance to roads, and gMIS. As per the Boruta and SHAP analyses, it was found that elevation, precipitation, and distance to rivers play the most crucial roles in the decision-making process for flood hazard assessment. The results indicated that the majority of the building footprints (15.27%) are at high and very high risk, followed by those at very low risk (43.80%), low risk (24.30%), and moderate risk (16.63%). Similarly, the cropland area affected by flooding in this region is categorized into five risk classes: very high (16.85%), high (17.28%), moderate (16.07%), low (16.51%), and very low (33.29%). However, this interdisciplinary study contributes significantly towards hydraulic and hydrological modeling for flood hazard management.

- **Abstract:** 
 We develop a tractable quantitative framework for modelling the rich patterns of spatial mobility observed in smartphone data. We show that travel is frequently undertaken as part of a travel itinerary, defined as a journey starting and ending at home that can include more than one intermediate stop on a given day. We show that these travel itineraries provide microfoundations for consumption externalities and generate both complementarity and substitutability between locations. We show that the consumption externalities implied by travel itineraries are central to matching quasi-experimental evidence from the shift to WFH. We find that these consumption externalities are key drivers of the agglomeration of economic activity in central cities and shape the relative welfare gains from alternative transport improvements in favor of investments in central cities.

- **DOI:** 10.1080/15481603.2025.2533487
- **Abstract:** ABSTRACT Wheat production is crucial in global food security and sustainable development, especially in severe global climate change, frequent extreme weather events, and significant population growth worldwide. A deeper understanding of spatial variation in wheat production and its determining factors is essential for implementing different cultivation practices, water and fertilizer management, and adaptive variety selection across different regions. However, existing methods primarily focused on identifying single-variable factors while lacking geographical spatial characteristics, which may lead to an incomplete exploration of spatial disparities in wheat production, predictions, and responses to changes in determining factors. This study develops a geospatial machine learning model by integrating spatial autocorrelation, spatial stratified heterogeneity, and decision tree to identify spatial disparities and their determinants of wheat production. The model is applied to wheat production analysis in Australia, the world’s 5th (2022) wheat-producing country. First, a spatial autocorrelation method is employed to identify the hotspot area of wheat production in Australia. Next, the geographically optimal zones-based heterogeneity (GOZH) model, an integration of spatial stratified heterogeneity and decision tree learning models, is used to identify determinants and their interactions on spatial disparities of wheat production. Finally, the developed geospatial machine learning model is evaluated by comparing its effectiveness with the commonly used geographical detector model. The results demonstrate pronounced spatial heterogeneity in Australian wheat production driven by environmental, climatic, and soil factors and their interactions. Identifying these spatial determinants enables more efficient crop management – such as targeted sub – regional practices, climate – adaptive variety selection, and soil health strategies – thereby supporting food security and sustainable agricultural systems.

- **DOI:** 10.3390/app15063361
- **Abstract:** The increasing cost of energy and the prevalence of electricity theft pose significant financial and operational challenges for energy providers. Traditional fraud detection methods often fail to identify sophisticated unauthorized consumption, particularly in non-smart-grid environments. This study proposes an advanced machine learning-based methodology for detecting energy fraud, leveraging real-world data from energy distribution networks. This approach integrates multiple machine learning models—k-nearest neighbors (kNN), decision trees, random forest, and artificial neural networks (ANNs)—to improve detection accuracy and efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate an 89.5% fraud detection accuracy, significantly outperforming conventional methods. Furthermore, the implementation of this model led to an estimated financial loss reduction of EUR 45,200. By analyzing historical consumption patterns, anomaly detection techniques, and geospatial data, the proposed system enhances fraud detection capabilities across both smart and non-smart grids. Future research will focus on real-time detection, scalability, and the integration of external data sources to further refine predictive accuracy.

- **Journal:** Geographical Analysis
- **Authors:** Zhenzhi Jiao, Ran Tao
- **Pub Date:** 2025-03-10
- **DOI:** 10.1111/gean.12423
- **Abstract:** This study proposes a new spatial machine‐learning model called geographical Gaussian process regression (GGPR). GGPR is extended from Gaussian process regression (GPR) by adopting the principle of spatial similarity for calibration, and it is designed to conduct spatial prediction and exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA). GGPR addresses several key challenges in spatial machine learning. First, as a probabilistic model, GGPR avoids the conflict between spatial autocorrelation and the assumption of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), thus enhancing the model's objectivity and reliability in spatial prediction. Second, GGPR is suitable for small‐sample prediction, a task that most existing models struggle with. Finally, when integrated with GeoShapley, GGPR is an explainable model that can measure spatial effects and explain the outcomes. Evaluated on two distinct datasets, GGPR demonstrates superior predictive performance compared to other popular machine‐learning models across various sampling ratios, with its advantage becoming especially evident with smaller sample sizes. As an ESDA model, GGPR demonstrates enhanced accuracy, better computational efficiency, and a comparable ability to measure spatial effects against both multiscale geographically weighted regression and geographical random forests. In short, GGPR offers spatial data scientists a new method for predicting and exploring complex geographical processes.

- **Abstract:** 
 Building on the availability of geospatial data, improvements in mapping software, and innovations in spatial statistics, political scientists are increasingly taking geography seriously. As we adopt the tools of geographers, we must also consider the methodological challenges they have identified. We focus on the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP)—the idea that the size of aggregate spatial units and the location of their borders affect the empirical results we obtain. We first describe the logic of the MAUP, and then demonstrate the MAUP through simulations, showing MAUP-related inconsistency in regression results in randomly generated and real-world data. We identify MAUP concerns, and best practices, in top journals in political science. We conclude by suggesting how scholars may respond in theoretical and empirical terms to concerns about validity and reliability that arise from the MAUP.

- **Abstract:** Flooding and other natural disasters threaten human life and property worldwide. They can cause significant damage to infrastructure and disrupt economies. Tamil Nadu coast is severely prone to flooding due to land use and climate changes. This research applies geospatial tools and machine learning to improve flood susceptibility mapping across the Tamil Nadu coast in India, using projections of Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) changes under current and future climate change scenarios. To identify flooded areas, the study utilised Google Earth Engine (GEE), Sentinel-1 data, and 12 geospatial datasets from multiple sources. A random forest algorithm was used for LULC change and flood susceptibility mapping. The LULC data are classified for the years 2000, 2010, and 2020, and from the classified data, the LULC for years 2030, 2040, and 2050 are projected for the study. Four future climate scenarios (SSP 126, 245, 370, and 585) were used for the average annual precipitation from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP6). The results showed that the random forest model performed better in classifying LULC and identifying flood-prone areas. From the results, it has been depicted that the risk of flooding will increase across all scenarios over the period of 2000–2100, with some decadal fluctuations. A significant outcome indicates that the percentage of the area transitioning to moderate and very high flood risk consistently rises across all future projections. This study presents a viable method for flood susceptibility mapping based on different climate change scenarios and yields estimates of flood risk, which can provide valuable insights for managing flood risks.

- **Abstract:** Freshwater ecosystems are increasingly facing major global and local stressors, while monitoring surface water status by regulatory agencies is often limited by financial and political constraints. Citizen science–based approaches with robust quality control and training can support regulatory monitoring and decision-making. Herein, we outline the criteria used to develop a citizen science monitoring program for water quality, based on a standardized methodology designed to support the Agenda 2030 indicator 6.3.2 and the EU’s Water Framework Directive. We explore the evolution of protocols used to ensure data robustness and transferability and examine the utility of contextual information registered by citizen scientists. We present laboratory and field experiments conducted to validate chemical and optical methods. Using the data from more than 80 projects across 4 biogeographical regions, we explore consistencies and differences in seasonal and spatial trends in macronutrient concentrations between regions. Our results indicate that nitrate and phosphate concentrations tend to increase in areas with agricultural intensification and industrial land use. Seasonally, nitrate concentrations reach a maximum in spring and autumn in temperate regions, while phosphate levels are highest in summer and autumn, reaching a minimum in winter. We also found that observations of algal blooms coincided with periods of lower nitrate concentrations. Importantly, data of ecological, chemical, and optical conditions recorded by citizen scientists are being used by local and regional stakeholders in managing freshwater ecosystems. This study reveals the potential for scaling citizen science–based monitoring programs to contribute towards a global assessment of water quality.

- **Abstract:** Water hyacinth (Pontederia crassipes) is an invasive weed that covers a significant portion of Lake Tana. The infestation has an impact on the lake’s ecological and socioeconomic systems. Early detection of the spread of water hyacinth using geospatial techniques is crucial for its effective management and control. The main objective of this study was to examine the spatiotemporal distribution of water hyacinth from 2016 to 2022 using a random forest machine learning model. The study used 16 variables obtained from Sentinel-2A, Sentinel-1 SAR, and SRTM DEM, and a random forest supervised classification model was applied. Seven spectral indices, five spectral bands, two Sentinel-1 SAR bands, and two topographic variables were used in combination to model the spatial distribution of water hyacinth. The model was evaluated using the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient. The findings demonstrated that the overall accuracy ranged from 0.91 to 0.94 and kappa coefficient from 0.88 to 0.92 in the wet season and 0.93 to 0.95 and 0.90 to 0.93 in the dry season, respectively. B11 and B5 (2022), VH, soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), and normalized difference water index (NDWI) (2020), B5 and B12 (2018), and VH and slope (2016) are the highly important variables in the classification. The study found that the spatial coverage of water hyacinth was 686.5 and 650.4 ha (2016), 1,851 and 1,259 ha (2018), 1,396.7 and 1,305.7 ha (2020), and 1,436.5 and 1,216.5 ha (2022) in the wet and dry seasons, respectively. The research findings indicate that variables derived from optical (Sentinel-2A and SRTM) and non-optical (Sentinel-1 SAR) satellite imagery effectively identify water hyacinth and display its spatiotemporal spread using the random forest machine learning algorithm.

- **Pub Date:** 2024-11-12
- **DOI:** 10.3390/app142210404
- **Abstract:** This paper presents a fault diagnosis technique for milling machines based on acoustic emission (AE) signals and a hybrid deep learning model optimized with a genetic algorithm. Mechanical failures in milling machines, particularly in critical components like cutting tools, gears, and bearings, account for a significant portion of operational breakdowns, leading to unplanned downtime and financial losses. To address this issue, the proposed method first acquires AE signals from the milling machine. AE signals, capturing the dynamic responses of machine components, are transformed into continuous wavelet transform (CWT) scalograms for further analysis. Gaussian filtering is applied to enhance the clarity of these scalograms, effectively reducing noise while maintaining essential features. A convolutional neural network (CNN) based on the VGG16 architecture is utilized for spatial feature extraction, followed by a bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) network to capture the temporal dependencies of the scalograms. The genetic algorithm (GA) is used to optimize feature selection and ensure the selection of the most relevant features to further improve the model’s performance. The optimized features are finally fed into a fully connected (FC) layer of the proposed hybrid model for fault classification. The proposed method achieves an accuracy of 99.6%, significantly outperforming traditional approaches. This method offers a highly accurate and efficient solution for fault detection in milling machines, allowing for more reliable predictive maintenance and operational efficiency in industrial settings.

- **Pub Date:** 2024-11-01
- **DOI:** 10.14530/se
- **Abstract:** This paper reviews recent research in spatial economics. The field of spatial economics is concerned with the determinants and effects of the location of economic activity in geographic space. It analyses how geographical location shapes the economic activities performed by agents, their interactions with one another, their welfare, and the effects of public policy interventions. Research in this area has benefited from the simultaneous development of new theoretical techniques, new sources of geographic information systems (GIS) data, rapid advances in computing power, machine learning and artificial intelligence, and renewed public policy interest in infrastructure and appropriate policies towards places “left-behind” by globalization and technology. Among the insights from this research are the role of goods and commuting market access in determining location choices; the conditions under which the location of economic activity is characterized by multiple equilibria; the circumstances under which temporary shocks can have permanent effects (hysteresis or path dependence); the heterogeneous and persistent impact of local shocks; the magnitude and spatial decay of agglomeration economics; and the role of both agglomeration forces and endogenous changes in land use in shaping the impact of transport infrastructure improvements.

- **Journal:** Geographical Analysis
- **Authors:** Lan Qing Zhao, S. Dragićević, Shivanand Balram, Liliana Perez
- **Pub Date:** 2025-03-27
- **DOI:** 10.1111/gean.70004
- **Abstract:** The analytical hierarchy process (AHP) is a widely used approach and a decision rule to derive criteria weights in geographic information system‐based multi‐criteria evaluation (GIS‐MCE). However, one limitation of the AHP method is that it constrains the number of criteria that can be meaningfully weighted to typically seven to nine criteria. Recently, machine learning (ML) techniques have emerged as a compelling alternative for deriving criteria weights. This research aims to assess the capabilities of ML‐MCE in handling a larger number of criteria and is specifically applied to a case study of urban suitability analysis. The random forest (RF) ML technique is used to evaluate the ability of the MCE method to handle up to 27 criteria. Geospatial data from the Metro Vancouver Region, Canada, are used, with the criteria subdivided into 11 groups starting with the most basic seven criteria and incrementally adding two new criteria per group. The results indicate the RF‐ML approach can manage a larger number of criteria compared to the traditional AHP approach, with 15 criteria providing a meaningful upper threshold, demonstrating its potential to accommodate a wider range of stakeholder preferences for complex urban suitability analysis contexts.

- **DOI:** 10.1080/07418825.2024.2401938
- **Abstract:** Abstract Building upon prior work, we propose an alternative way to look at the pattern of spatial crime concentration and temporal stability of it. We first identify a high-crime cluster using the sample block groups in New York City by employing a k-means clustering method. We then examine the temporal stability of the high-crime cluster over time. We also longitudinally assess how our high-crime cluster classification is associated with the actual amount of crime while accounting for the measures of social and physical environments. We observed that about 6–12% of total areas are identified to be in the high-crime cluster. We also found that block groups identified to be high-crime cluster in one year are more likely to be that way in the next year. We hope future research may consider using data-driven approaches to expand understanding of spatial and temporal crime patterns.

- **Pub Date:** 2024-10-03
- **DOI:** 10.1021/acs.est.4c02464
- **Abstract:** The neighborhood effect averaging problem (NEAP) is a fundamental statistical phenomenon in mobility-dependent environmental exposures. It suggests that individual environmental exposures tend toward the average exposure in the study area when considering human mobility. However, the universality of the NEAP across various environmental exposures and the mechanisms underlying its occurrence remain unclear. Here, using a large human mobility data set of more than 27 000 individuals in the Chicago Metropolitan Area, we provide robust evidence of the existence of the NEAP in a range of individual environmental exposures, including green spaces, air pollution, healthy food environments, transit accessibility, and crime rates. We also unveil the social and spatial disparities in the NEAP’s influence on individual environmental exposure estimates. To further reveal the mechanisms behind the NEAP, we perform multiscenario analyses based on environmental variation and human mobility simulations. The results reveal that the NEAP is a statistical phenomenon of regression to the mean (RTM) under the constraints of spatial autocorrelation in environmental data. Increasing travel distances and out-of-home durations can intensify and promote the NEAP’s impact, particularly for highly dynamic environmental factors like air pollution. These findings illuminate the complex interplay between human mobility and environmental factors, guiding more effective public health interventions.

- **DOI:** 10.1080/10095020.2024.2374996
- **Abstract:** ABSTRACT Urban land use information is essential for urban planning and sustainable development. However, the increasing prevalence of Mixed-Use Urban Land (MUUL) introduces uncertainty in land use mapping. Due to the compatibility of different human activities within MUUL, identifying MUUL is still a challenge for scholars. In this study, we proposed a novel framework by integrating geographic big data and machine learning to identify it. First, to be consistent with urban planning practices, we delineated mapping units from urban planning map. Second, based on the variability of the spatial pattern of POIs, two indices, the Amount of POI (AP) and the Deviation Index (DI), were developed. Finally, the random forest model was employed. The empirical study in the Jianghan District of Wuhan, China, showed that the MUUL and non-MUUL exhibited significant spatial pattern of POIs separability, the average AP and DI of the MUUL were much larger than those of the non-MUUL. Moreover, the relatively high identification accuracy (Kappa Coefficient (KC) = 0.85, Hellden’s Mean Accuracy (MA) = 0.87) further demonstrated the effectiveness of the developed indices. The proposed framework in this study can reduce the adverse impacts of MUUL on urban land identification by avoiding the MUUL from being incorrectly identified as a single function. Moreover, by extracting MUUL in advance, it can improve the research efficiency by avoiding the application of the segmentation algorithm to all mapping units as in the previous study. Overall, this study provides important references for scholars to increase the accuracy of urban land use identification and allows authorities and policymakers to monitor the dynamics of MUUL that are essential to urban vibrancy. The spatial pattern indices proposed in this study can also be applied to urban land use identification studies as important features.

- **Abstract:** In the era of rapid advancements in artificial intelligence, the geospatial field is experiencing transformative changes. Traditional methods for land cover classification and anomaly detection have often been inconsistent and inaccurate, leading to significant real-world issues such as resource misallocation, unnoticed illegal activities like deforestation, unmonitored topographical changes such as unauthorized constructions, unattended forest fires, and border fence crises, all of which exacerbate climate change and urbanization challenges. This study systematically explores various machine learning (ML) techniques and their application to publicly available geospatial datasets. Specifically, it compares selected Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and other ML models on these datasets to evaluate multiple performance metrics and conduct a comparative analysis. While numerous ML models have been previously employed for land cover classification and anomaly detection, this review seeks to enhance performance metrics and improve classification accuracy. Prior studies have employed techniques such as Random Forest on Sentinel-2 data (Gromny et al., 2019), multiple regression approaches on Landsat data (Wu et al., 2016), and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on OpenStreetMap data (Feldmeyer et al., 2020). Our study introduces the application of advanced models like VGG16, UNet, and Isolation Forest to geospatial datasets, assessing their impact on enhancing land cover classification and anomaly detection. This research not only aims to achieve higher classification accuracy but also contributes to the field by providing insights into the effectiveness of these models and proposing future directions and opportunities.

- **Abstract:** Land degradation from gully erosion poses a significant threat to the Erer watershed in Eastern Ethiopia, particularly due to agricultural activities and resource exploitation. Identifying erosion-prone areas and underlying factors using advanced machine learning algorithms (MLAs) and geospatial analysis is crucial for addressing this problem and prioritizing adaptive and mitigating strategies. However, previous studies have not leveraged machine learning (ML) and GIS-based approaches to generate susceptibility maps identifying these areas and conditioning factors, hindering sustainable watershed management solutions. This study aimed to predict gully erosion susceptibility (GES) and identify underlying areas and factors in the Erer watershed. Four ML models, namely, XGBoost, random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and artificial neural network (ANN), were integrated with geospatial analysis using 22 geoenvironmental predictors and 1,200 inventory points (70% used for training and 30% for testing). Model performance and robustness were validated through the area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, kappa coefficient, F1 score, and logarithmic loss. The relative slope position is most influential, with 100% importance in SVM and RF and 95% importance in XGBoost, while annual rainfall (AR) dominated ANN (100% importance). Notably, XGBoost demonstrated robustness and superior prediction/mapping, achieving an AUC of 0.97, 91% accuracy, 92% precision, and 81% kappa while maintaining a low logloss (0.0394). However, SVM excelled in classifying gully resistant/susceptible areas (97% sensitivity, 98% specificity, and 91% F1 score). The ANN model predicted the most areas with very high gully susceptibility (13.74%), followed by the SVM (11.69%), XGBoost (10.65%), and RF (7.85%) models, while XGBoost identified the most areas with very low susceptibility (70.19%). The ensemble technique was employed to further enhance GES modeling, and it outperformed the individual models, achieving an AUC of 0.99, 93.5% accuracy, 92.5% precision, 97.5% sensitivity, 95.4% specificity, 85.8% kappa, and 94.9% F1 score. This technique also classified the GES of the watershed as 36.48% very low, 26.51% low, 16.24% moderate, 11.55% high, and 9.22% very high. Furthermore, district-level analyses revealed the most susceptible areas, including the Babile, Fedis, Harar, and Meyumuluke districts, with high GES areas of 32.4%, 21.3%, 14.3%, and 13.6%, respectively. This study offers robust and flexible ML models with comprehensive validation metrics to enhance GES modeling and identify gully prone areas and factors, thereby supporting decision-making for sustainable watershed conservation and land degradation prevention.

- **Abstract:** Flooding is a major natural hazard worldwide, causing catastrophic damage to communities and infrastructure. Due to climate change exacerbating extreme weather events robust flood hazard modeling is crucial to support disaster resilience and adaptation. This study uses multi-sourced geospatial datasets to develop an advanced machine learning framework for flood hazard assessment in the Arambag region of West Bengal, India. The flood inventory was constructed through Sentinel-1 SAR analysis and global flood databases. Fifteen flood conditioning factors related to topography, land cover, soil, rainfall, proximity, and demographics were incorporated. Rigorous training and testing of diverse machine learning models, including RF, AdaBoost, rFerns, XGB, DeepBoost, GBM, SDA, BAM, monmlp, and MARS algorithms, were undertaken for categorical flood hazard mapping. Model optimization was achieved through statistical feature selection techniques. Accuracy metrics and advanced model interpretability methods like SHAP and Boruta were implemented to evaluate predictive performance. According to the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), the prediction accuracy of the models performed was around > 80%. RF achieves an AUC of 0.847 at resampling factor 5, indicating strong discriminative performance. AdaBoost also consistently exhibits good discriminative ability, with AUC values of 0.839 at resampling factor 10. Boruta and SHAP analysis indicated precipitation and elevation as factors most significantly contributing to flood hazard assessment in the study area. Most of the machine learning models pointed out southern portions of the study area as highly susceptible areas. On average, from 17.2 to 18.6% of the study area is highly susceptible to flood hazards. In the feature selection analysis, various nature-inspired algorithms identified the selected input parameters for flood hazard assessment, i.e., elevation, precipitation, distance to rivers, TWI, geomorphology, lithology, TRI, slope, soil type, curvature, NDVI, distance to roads, and gMIS. As per the Boruta and SHAP analyses, it was found that elevation, precipitation, and distance to rivers play the most crucial roles in the decision-making process for flood hazard assessment. The results indicated that the majority of the building footprints (15.27%) are at high and very high risk, followed by those at very low risk (43.80%), low risk (24.30%), and moderate risk (16.63%). Similarly, the cropland area affected by flooding in this region is categorized into five risk classes: very high (16.85%), high (17.28%), moderate (16.07%), low (16.51%), and very low (33.29%). However, this interdisciplinary study contributes significantly towards hydraulic and hydrological modeling for flood hazard management.

- **Abstract:** As the world's population continues to surge, the earth's ecological limits are being stretched. Some of the major threats to habitability stem from the pursuit of perpetual economic growth, and power struggles among nations, leading to ecological and social destruction and ongoing crises. A shift toward wiser earth management could enhance habitability through collective strategies within a global political framework. Key components include adopting renewable energy, limiting ecological footprints, fostering clean prosperity, and promoting peaceful coexistence among nations. Our survival hinges on embracing cooperative security and transitioning toward a collective approach to governance, redirecting resources from militarization toward protection of the global commons. This necessitates international collaboration and democratic participation across temporal and spatial scales, facilitated by a UN-led framework. We believe science should play a crucial role in developing common strategies for a viable world, contingent upon decision-makers prioritizing global cooperation over narrow short-term self-interest. Scientists and policymakers can work together, creating more viable futures through international cooperation and a move away from violence. Moreover, citizens have an important role to play by changing their lifestyles and supporting measures mentioned in this paper.

- **DOI:** 10.2139/ssrn.4742035
- **Abstract:** With average temperature ranging from −20°C at the North Pole to 30°C at the Equator and with global warming expected to reach 1.4°C to 4.5°C by the year 2100, it is clear that climate change will have vastly different effects across the globe. Given the abundance of land in northern latitudes, if population and economic activity could freely move across space, the economic cost of global warming would be greatly reduced. However, spatial frictions are real: migrants face barriers, trade and transportation are costly, physical infrastructure is not footloose, and knowledge embedded in clusters of economic activity diffuses only imperfectly. Thus, the economic cost of climate change is intimately connected to these spatial frictions. Building on earlier integrated assessment models (IAMs) that largely ignored space, in the past decade there has been significant progress in developing dynamic spatial integrated assessment models (S-IAMs) aimed at providing a more realistic evaluation of the economic cost of climate change, both locally and globally. This review discusses this progress and provides a guide for future work in this area.
