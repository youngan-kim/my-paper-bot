- **Abstract:** Freshwater ecosystems are increasingly facing major global and local stressors, while monitoring surface water status by regulatory agencies is often limited by financial and political constraints. Citizen science–based approaches with robust quality control and training can support regulatory monitoring and decision-making. Herein, we outline the criteria used to develop a citizen science monitoring program for water quality, based on a standardized methodology designed to support the Agenda 2030 indicator 6.3.2 and the EU’s Water Framework Directive. We explore the evolution of protocols used to ensure data robustness and transferability and examine the utility of contextual information registered by citizen scientists. We present laboratory and field experiments conducted to validate chemical and optical methods. Using the data from more than 80 projects across 4 biogeographical regions, we explore consistencies and differences in seasonal and spatial trends in macronutrient concentrations between regions. Our results indicate that nitrate and phosphate concentrations tend to increase in areas with agricultural intensification and industrial land use. Seasonally, nitrate concentrations reach a maximum in spring and autumn in temperate regions, while phosphate levels are highest in summer and autumn, reaching a minimum in winter. We also found that observations of algal blooms coincided with periods of lower nitrate concentrations. Importantly, data of ecological, chemical, and optical conditions recorded by citizen scientists are being used by local and regional stakeholders in managing freshwater ecosystems. This study reveals the potential for scaling citizen science–based monitoring programs to contribute towards a global assessment of water quality.

- **Abstract:** Water hyacinth (Pontederia crassipes) is an invasive weed that covers a significant portion of Lake Tana. The infestation has an impact on the lake’s ecological and socioeconomic systems. Early detection of the spread of water hyacinth using geospatial techniques is crucial for its effective management and control. The main objective of this study was to examine the spatiotemporal distribution of water hyacinth from 2016 to 2022 using a random forest machine learning model. The study used 16 variables obtained from Sentinel-2A, Sentinel-1 SAR, and SRTM DEM, and a random forest supervised classification model was applied. Seven spectral indices, five spectral bands, two Sentinel-1 SAR bands, and two topographic variables were used in combination to model the spatial distribution of water hyacinth. The model was evaluated using the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient. The findings demonstrated that the overall accuracy ranged from 0.91 to 0.94 and kappa coefficient from 0.88 to 0.92 in the wet season and 0.93 to 0.95 and 0.90 to 0.93 in the dry season, respectively. B11 and B5 (2022), VH, soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), and normalized difference water index (NDWI) (2020), B5 and B12 (2018), and VH and slope (2016) are the highly important variables in the classification. The study found that the spatial coverage of water hyacinth was 686.5 and 650.4 ha (2016), 1,851 and 1,259 ha (2018), 1,396.7 and 1,305.7 ha (2020), and 1,436.5 and 1,216.5 ha (2022) in the wet and dry seasons, respectively. The research findings indicate that variables derived from optical (Sentinel-2A and SRTM) and non-optical (Sentinel-1 SAR) satellite imagery effectively identify water hyacinth and display its spatiotemporal spread using the random forest machine learning algorithm.

## 8. [Milling Machine Fault Diagnosis Using Acoustic Emission and Hybrid Deep Learning with Feature Optimization](https://doi.org/10.3390/app142210404)

- **DOI:** [10.3390/app142210404](https://doi.org/10.3390/app142210404)
- **Abstract:** This paper presents a fault diagnosis technique for milling machines based on acoustic emission (AE) signals and a hybrid deep learning model optimized with a genetic algorithm. Mechanical failures in milling machines, particularly in critical components like cutting tools, gears, and bearings, account for a significant portion of operational breakdowns, leading to unplanned downtime and financial losses. To address this issue, the proposed method first acquires AE signals from the milling machine. AE signals, capturing the dynamic responses of machine components, are transformed into continuous wavelet transform (CWT) scalograms for further analysis. Gaussian filtering is applied to enhance the clarity of these scalograms, effectively reducing noise while maintaining essential features. A convolutional neural network (CNN) based on the VGG16 architecture is utilized for spatial feature extraction, followed by a bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) network to capture the temporal dependencies of the scalograms. The genetic algorithm (GA) is used to optimize feature selection and ensure the selection of the most relevant features to further improve the model’s performance. The optimized features are finally fed into a fully connected (FC) layer of the proposed hybrid model for fault classification. The proposed method achieves an accuracy of 99.6%, significantly outperforming traditional approaches. This method offers a highly accurate and efficient solution for fault detection in milling machines, allowing for more reliable predictive maintenance and operational efficiency in industrial settings.

## 10. [Spatial Economics](https://doi.org/10.14530/se)
- **Authors:** Stephen J. Redding
- **Journal:** Social Science Research Network
- **Date:** 2024-11-01
- **DOI:** [10.14530/se](https://doi.org/10.14530/se)
- **Abstract:** This paper reviews recent research in spatial economics. The field of spatial economics is concerned with the determinants and effects of the location of economic activity in geographic space. It analyses how geographical location shapes the economic activities performed by agents, their interactions with one another, their welfare, and the effects of public policy interventions. Research in this area has benefited from the simultaneous development of new theoretical techniques, new sources of geographic information systems (GIS) data, rapid advances in computing power, machine learning and artificial intelligence, and renewed public policy interest in infrastructure and appropriate policies towards places “left-behind” by globalization and technology. Among the insights from this research are the role of goods and commuting market access in determining location choices; the conditions under which the location of economic activity is characterized by multiple equilibria; the circumstances under which temporary shocks can have permanent effects (hysteresis or path dependence); the heterogeneous and persistent impact of local shocks; the magnitude and spatial decay of agglomeration economics; and the role of both agglomeration forces and endogenous changes in land use in shaping the impact of transport infrastructure improvements.

- **Abstract:** Abstract Building upon prior work, we propose an alternative way to look at the pattern of spatial crime concentration and temporal stability of it. We first identify a high-crime cluster using the sample block groups in New York City by employing a k-means clustering method. We then examine the temporal stability of the high-crime cluster over time. We also longitudinally assess how our high-crime cluster classification is associated with the actual amount of crime while accounting for the measures of social and physical environments. We observed that about 6–12% of total areas are identified to be in the high-crime cluster. We also found that block groups identified to be high-crime cluster in one year are more likely to be that way in the next year. We hope future research may consider using data-driven approaches to expand understanding of spatial and temporal crime patterns.

## 13. [The Universal Neighborhood Effect Averaging in Mobility-Dependent Environmental Exposures](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.4c02464)

- **Date:** 2024-10-03
- **DOI:** [10.1021/acs.est.4c02464](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.4c02464)
- **Abstract:** The neighborhood effect averaging problem (NEAP) is a fundamental statistical phenomenon in mobility-dependent environmental exposures. It suggests that individual environmental exposures tend toward the average exposure in the study area when considering human mobility. However, the universality of the NEAP across various environmental exposures and the mechanisms underlying its occurrence remain unclear. Here, using a large human mobility data set of more than 27 000 individuals in the Chicago Metropolitan Area, we provide robust evidence of the existence of the NEAP in a range of individual environmental exposures, including green spaces, air pollution, healthy food environments, transit accessibility, and crime rates. We also unveil the social and spatial disparities in the NEAP’s influence on individual environmental exposure estimates. To further reveal the mechanisms behind the NEAP, we perform multiscenario analyses based on environmental variation and human mobility simulations. The results reveal that the NEAP is a statistical phenomenon of regression to the mean (RTM) under the constraints of spatial autocorrelation in environmental data. Increasing travel distances and out-of-home durations can intensify and promote the NEAP’s impact, particularly for highly dynamic environmental factors like air pollution. These findings illuminate the complex interplay between human mobility and environmental factors, guiding more effective public health interventions.

## 15. [Mixed-use urban land parcels identification integrating geospatial data and machine learning](https://doi.org/10.1080/10095020.2024.2374996)

- **DOI:** [10.1080/10095020.2024.2374996](https://doi.org/10.1080/10095020.2024.2374996)
- **Abstract:** ABSTRACT Urban land use information is essential for urban planning and sustainable development. However, the increasing prevalence of Mixed-Use Urban Land (MUUL) introduces uncertainty in land use mapping. Due to the compatibility of different human activities within MUUL, identifying MUUL is still a challenge for scholars. In this study, we proposed a novel framework by integrating geographic big data and machine learning to identify it. First, to be consistent with urban planning practices, we delineated mapping units from urban planning map. Second, based on the variability of the spatial pattern of POIs, two indices, the Amount of POI (AP) and the Deviation Index (DI), were developed. Finally, the random forest model was employed. The empirical study in the Jianghan District of Wuhan, China, showed that the MUUL and non-MUUL exhibited significant spatial pattern of POIs separability, the average AP and DI of the MUUL were much larger than those of the non-MUUL. Moreover, the relatively high identification accuracy (Kappa Coefficient (KC) = 0.85, Hellden’s Mean Accuracy (MA) = 0.87) further demonstrated the effectiveness of the developed indices. The proposed framework in this study can reduce the adverse impacts of MUUL on urban land identification by avoiding the MUUL from being incorrectly identified as a single function. Moreover, by extracting MUUL in advance, it can improve the research efficiency by avoiding the application of the segmentation algorithm to all mapping units as in the previous study. Overall, this study provides important references for scholars to increase the accuracy of urban land use identification and allows authorities and policymakers to monitor the dynamics of MUUL that are essential to urban vibrancy. The spatial pattern indices proposed in this study can also be applied to urban land use identification studies as important features.

- **Abstract:** In the era of rapid advancements in artificial intelligence, the geospatial field is experiencing transformative changes. Traditional methods for land cover classification and anomaly detection have often been inconsistent and inaccurate, leading to significant real-world issues such as resource misallocation, unnoticed illegal activities like deforestation, unmonitored topographical changes such as unauthorized constructions, unattended forest fires, and border fence crises, all of which exacerbate climate change and urbanization challenges. This study systematically explores various machine learning (ML) techniques and their application to publicly available geospatial datasets. Specifically, it compares selected Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and other ML models on these datasets to evaluate multiple performance metrics and conduct a comparative analysis. While numerous ML models have been previously employed for land cover classification and anomaly detection, this review seeks to enhance performance metrics and improve classification accuracy. Prior studies have employed techniques such as Random Forest on Sentinel-2 data (Gromny et al., 2019), multiple regression approaches on Landsat data (Wu et al., 2016), and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on OpenStreetMap data (Feldmeyer et al., 2020). Our study introduces the application of advanced models like VGG16, UNet, and Isolation Forest to geospatial datasets, assessing their impact on enhancing land cover classification and anomaly detection. This research not only aims to achieve higher classification accuracy but also contributes to the field by providing insights into the effectiveness of these models and proposing future directions and opportunities.

- **Abstract:** Land degradation from gully erosion poses a significant threat to the Erer watershed in Eastern Ethiopia, particularly due to agricultural activities and resource exploitation. Identifying erosion-prone areas and underlying factors using advanced machine learning algorithms (MLAs) and geospatial analysis is crucial for addressing this problem and prioritizing adaptive and mitigating strategies. However, previous studies have not leveraged machine learning (ML) and GIS-based approaches to generate susceptibility maps identifying these areas and conditioning factors, hindering sustainable watershed management solutions. This study aimed to predict gully erosion susceptibility (GES) and identify underlying areas and factors in the Erer watershed. Four ML models, namely, XGBoost, random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and artificial neural network (ANN), were integrated with geospatial analysis using 22 geoenvironmental predictors and 1,200 inventory points (70% used for training and 30% for testing). Model performance and robustness were validated through the area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, kappa coefficient, F1 score, and logarithmic loss. The relative slope position is most influential, with 100% importance in SVM and RF and 95% importance in XGBoost, while annual rainfall (AR) dominated ANN (100% importance). Notably, XGBoost demonstrated robustness and superior prediction/mapping, achieving an AUC of 0.97, 91% accuracy, 92% precision, and 81% kappa while maintaining a low logloss (0.0394). However, SVM excelled in classifying gully resistant/susceptible areas (97% sensitivity, 98% specificity, and 91% F1 score). The ANN model predicted the most areas with very high gully susceptibility (13.74%), followed by the SVM (11.69%), XGBoost (10.65%), and RF (7.85%) models, while XGBoost identified the most areas with very low susceptibility (70.19%). The ensemble technique was employed to further enhance GES modeling, and it outperformed the individual models, achieving an AUC of 0.99, 93.5% accuracy, 92.5% precision, 97.5% sensitivity, 95.4% specificity, 85.8% kappa, and 94.9% F1 score. This technique also classified the GES of the watershed as 36.48% very low, 26.51% low, 16.24% moderate, 11.55% high, and 9.22% very high. Furthermore, district-level analyses revealed the most susceptible areas, including the Babile, Fedis, Harar, and Meyumuluke districts, with high GES areas of 32.4%, 21.3%, 14.3%, and 13.6%, respectively. This study offers robust and flexible ML models with comprehensive validation metrics to enhance GES modeling and identify gully prone areas and factors, thereby supporting decision-making for sustainable watershed conservation and land degradation prevention.

- **Abstract:** Assessing and understanding the urban scale impacts of extreme climate events is a global necessity. Risks associated with heat, where intra-urban dynamics and rural/urban boundary conditions greatly impact its distribution, are of particular interest as the evolution of climate change and ur-banization persists. Characterizing Urban Heat Island (UHI) effects is dependent on the availability of high-resolution near-surface air temperature maps and a description of the Local Climate Zones (LCZs). This study assesses the applicability of state-of-the-art (SOTA) Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques for UHI detection and characterization. A Geospatial Foundation Model (GFM) is fine-tuned to predict 2 m air temperature at a 1 km resolution for the urban areas of Johannesburg, South Africa, with mean absolute error measures less than 1.5 °C. UHI characterization is further enabled through a Fully Connected Network (FCN) model for LCZs classification for the same region of interest.

- **Abstract:** Flooding is a major natural hazard worldwide, causing catastrophic damage to communities and infrastructure. Due to climate change exacerbating extreme weather events robust flood hazard modeling is crucial to support disaster resilience and adaptation. This study uses multi-sourced geospatial datasets to develop an advanced machine learning framework for flood hazard assessment in the Arambag region of West Bengal, India. The flood inventory was constructed through Sentinel-1 SAR analysis and global flood databases. Fifteen flood conditioning factors related to topography, land cover, soil, rainfall, proximity, and demographics were incorporated. Rigorous training and testing of diverse machine learning models, including RF, AdaBoost, rFerns, XGB, DeepBoost, GBM, SDA, BAM, monmlp, and MARS algorithms, were undertaken for categorical flood hazard mapping. Model optimization was achieved through statistical feature selection techniques. Accuracy metrics and advanced model interpretability methods like SHAP and Boruta were implemented to evaluate predictive performance. According to the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), the prediction accuracy of the models performed was around > 80%. RF achieves an AUC of 0.847 at resampling factor 5, indicating strong discriminative performance. AdaBoost also consistently exhibits good discriminative ability, with AUC values of 0.839 at resampling factor 10. Boruta and SHAP analysis indicated precipitation and elevation as factors most significantly contributing to flood hazard assessment in the study area. Most of the machine learning models pointed out southern portions of the study area as highly susceptible areas. On average, from 17.2 to 18.6% of the study area is highly susceptible to flood hazards. In the feature selection analysis, various nature-inspired algorithms identified the selected input parameters for flood hazard assessment, i.e., elevation, precipitation, distance to rivers, TWI, geomorphology, lithology, TRI, slope, soil type, curvature, NDVI, distance to roads, and gMIS. As per the Boruta and SHAP analyses, it was found that elevation, precipitation, and distance to rivers play the most crucial roles in the decision-making process for flood hazard assessment. The results indicated that the majority of the building footprints (15.27%) are at high and very high risk, followed by those at very low risk (43.80%), low risk (24.30%), and moderate risk (16.63%). Similarly, the cropland area affected by flooding in this region is categorized into five risk classes: very high (16.85%), high (17.28%), moderate (16.07%), low (16.51%), and very low (33.29%). However, this interdisciplinary study contributes significantly towards hydraulic and hydrological modeling for flood hazard management.

- **Abstract:** 
 We develop a tractable quantitative framework for modelling the rich patterns of spatial mobility observed in smartphone data. We show that travel is frequently undertaken as part of a travel itinerary, defined as a journey starting and ending at home that can include more than one intermediate stop on a given day. We show that these travel itineraries provide microfoundations for consumption externalities and generate both complementarity and substitutability between locations. We show that the consumption externalities implied by travel itineraries are central to matching quasi-experimental evidence from the shift to WFH. We find that these consumption externalities are key drivers of the agglomeration of economic activity in central cities and shape the relative welfare gains from alternative transport improvements in favor of investments in central cities.

- **Abstract:** ABSTRACT Wheat production is crucial in global food security and sustainable development, especially in severe global climate change, frequent extreme weather events, and significant population growth worldwide. A deeper understanding of spatial variation in wheat production and its determining factors is essential for implementing different cultivation practices, water and fertilizer management, and adaptive variety selection across different regions. However, existing methods primarily focused on identifying single-variable factors while lacking geographical spatial characteristics, which may lead to an incomplete exploration of spatial disparities in wheat production, predictions, and responses to changes in determining factors. This study develops a geospatial machine learning model by integrating spatial autocorrelation, spatial stratified heterogeneity, and decision tree to identify spatial disparities and their determinants of wheat production. The model is applied to wheat production analysis in Australia, the world’s 5th (2022) wheat-producing country. First, a spatial autocorrelation method is employed to identify the hotspot area of wheat production in Australia. Next, the geographically optimal zones-based heterogeneity (GOZH) model, an integration of spatial stratified heterogeneity and decision tree learning models, is used to identify determinants and their interactions on spatial disparities of wheat production. Finally, the developed geospatial machine learning model is evaluated by comparing its effectiveness with the commonly used geographical detector model. The results demonstrate pronounced spatial heterogeneity in Australian wheat production driven by environmental, climatic, and soil factors and their interactions. Identifying these spatial determinants enables more efficient crop management – such as targeted sub – regional practices, climate – adaptive variety selection, and soil health strategies – thereby supporting food security and sustainable agricultural systems.
