- **Abstract:** This study examines the spatial crime perception gap (SCPG), the mismatch between perceived and actual crime, which can lead to unnecessary avoidance behaviors, anxiety, or lack of vigilance. While few studies have explored this phenomenon from a spatial perspective, this research analyses the collective spatial perception of safety and unsafety in Vienna and Budapest and compares them with recorded crime patterns. Using a digital sketch map survey tool, 656 participants identified safe and unsafe areas as well as their daily routes. The responses were analyzed using spatial analytical and statistical methods to delineate the perception gaps in space, which were also diversified by crime type aggregations, including all crimes, violent crimes, property crimes, and visible crimes. Distance-based analyses were also conducted to examine the “spatial diffusion” and “spatial endowment” effects. The results show that many areas that are perceived as unsafe are not statistical crime hotspots. Perception aligns more closely with violent crime patterns than with property or visible crimes. The spatial diffusion effect illustrates that crime hotspots may influence and expand the perception of unsafety in adjacent and nearby areas. The spatial endowment effect suggests that people are more likely to perceive an area as unsafe if it is further away from their activity spaces, while overlooking crime hotspots that may intersect with it. These patterns were consistent across both cities, although the perception gap was larger in Budapest, while the endowment effect was more pronounced in Vienna. By highlighting where and how perception diverges from reality, this study provides insights that can inform strategies to reduce unfounded fear and strengthen the perceived safety and psychological resilience of urban populations.

- **DOI:** [10.1093/qje/qjaf038](https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qjaf038)
- **Abstract:** 
 We develop a tractable quantitative framework for modelling the rich patterns of spatial mobility observed in smartphone data. We show that travel is frequently undertaken as part of a travel itinerary, defined as a journey starting and ending at home that can include more than one intermediate stop on a given day. We show that these travel itineraries provide microfoundations for consumption externalities and generate both complementarity and substitutability between locations. We show that the consumption externalities implied by travel itineraries are central to matching quasi-experimental evidence from the shift to WFH. We find that these consumption externalities are key drivers of the agglomeration of economic activity in central cities and shape the relative welfare gains from alternative transport improvements in favor of investments in central cities.

## 5. [Geospatial machine learning for flood risk assessment in contrasting physiographic environments](https://doi.org/10.30574/wjaets.2025.16.1.1232)

- **Abstract:** One of the biggest hydrological hazards in Sub-Saharan Africa is flooding, which is exacerbated by increasing rainfall, inadequate drainage systems, and growing urbanization. In Nigeria, fragmented datasets and inadequate methodological integration continue to limit the ability to map flood susceptibility in a spatially detailed manner. This work presents a hybrid framework that creates interpretable and highly accurate flood susceptibility models for two physiographically distinct regions: Ile-Ife (inland uplands) and Ilaje (coastal lowlands) by combining the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) with the Random Forest (RF) classifier. For Ilaje and Ile-Ife, a total of 43,825 and 8,632 spatial sample points were produced. In order to create a composite Flood Susceptibility Index (FSI), four flood-related predictors elevation, slope, rainfall, and distance to river were normalized and weighted using AHP. To train RF models for each region, the FSI was reclassified into three risk categories. F1-scores, precision, recall, and confusion matrices were used to assess the model’s performance. According to the results, Ilaje and Ile-Ife had classification accuracy rates of 98% and 97%, respectively. In both areas, rainfall and river proximity were the most important predictors, whereas the complexity of the terrain affected the patterns of susceptibility. The AHP-RF framework proved to be highly transparent and dependable, providing a scalable flood risk zoning tool, especially in settings with limited data. This work promotes interpretable geospatial modeling for disaster risk reduction by combining machine learning and expert judgment. The results provide a replicable model for climate adaptation in flood-prone areas of Sub-Saharan Africa and support the incorporation of physiographically informed flood planning into policy frameworks.

- **Abstract:** ABSTRACT Wheat production is crucial in global food security and sustainable development, especially in severe global climate change, frequent extreme weather events, and significant population growth worldwide. A deeper understanding of spatial variation in wheat production and its determining factors is essential for implementing different cultivation practices, water and fertilizer management, and adaptive variety selection across different regions. However, existing methods primarily focused on identifying single-variable factors while lacking geographical spatial characteristics, which may lead to an incomplete exploration of spatial disparities in wheat production, predictions, and responses to changes in determining factors. This study develops a geospatial machine learning model by integrating spatial autocorrelation, spatial stratified heterogeneity, and decision tree to identify spatial disparities and their determinants of wheat production. The model is applied to wheat production analysis in Australia, the world’s 5th (2022) wheat-producing country. First, a spatial autocorrelation method is employed to identify the hotspot area of wheat production in Australia. Next, the geographically optimal zones-based heterogeneity (GOZH) model, an integration of spatial stratified heterogeneity and decision tree learning models, is used to identify determinants and their interactions on spatial disparities of wheat production. Finally, the developed geospatial machine learning model is evaluated by comparing its effectiveness with the commonly used geographical detector model. The results demonstrate pronounced spatial heterogeneity in Australian wheat production driven by environmental, climatic, and soil factors and their interactions. Identifying these spatial determinants enables more efficient crop management – such as targeted sub – regional practices, climate – adaptive variety selection, and soil health strategies – thereby supporting food security and sustainable agricultural systems.

- **Abstract:** The increasing cost of energy and the prevalence of electricity theft pose significant financial and operational challenges for energy providers. Traditional fraud detection methods often fail to identify sophisticated unauthorized consumption, particularly in non-smart-grid environments. This study proposes an advanced machine learning-based methodology for detecting energy fraud, leveraging real-world data from energy distribution networks. This approach integrates multiple machine learning models—k-nearest neighbors (kNN), decision trees, random forest, and artificial neural networks (ANNs)—to improve detection accuracy and efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate an 89.5% fraud detection accuracy, significantly outperforming conventional methods. Furthermore, the implementation of this model led to an estimated financial loss reduction of EUR 45,200. By analyzing historical consumption patterns, anomaly detection techniques, and geospatial data, the proposed system enhances fraud detection capabilities across both smart and non-smart grids. Future research will focus on real-time detection, scalability, and the integration of external data sources to further refine predictive accuracy.

## 15. [Geographical Gaussian Process Regression: A Spatial Machine‐Learning Model Based on Spatial Similarity](https://doi.org/10.1111/gean.12423)
- **Authors:** Zhenzhi Jiao, Ran Tao
- **Journal:** Geographical Analysis
- **Date:** 2025-03-10
- **DOI:** [10.1111/gean.12423](https://doi.org/10.1111/gean.12423)
- **Abstract:** This study proposes a new spatial machine‐learning model called geographical Gaussian process regression (GGPR). GGPR is extended from Gaussian process regression (GPR) by adopting the principle of spatial similarity for calibration, and it is designed to conduct spatial prediction and exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA). GGPR addresses several key challenges in spatial machine learning. First, as a probabilistic model, GGPR avoids the conflict between spatial autocorrelation and the assumption of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), thus enhancing the model's objectivity and reliability in spatial prediction. Second, GGPR is suitable for small‐sample prediction, a task that most existing models struggle with. Finally, when integrated with GeoShapley, GGPR is an explainable model that can measure spatial effects and explain the outcomes. Evaluated on two distinct datasets, GGPR demonstrates superior predictive performance compared to other popular machine‐learning models across various sampling ratios, with its advantage becoming especially evident with smaller sample sizes. As an ESDA model, GGPR demonstrates enhanced accuracy, better computational efficiency, and a comparable ability to measure spatial effects against both multiscale geographically weighted regression and geographical random forests. In short, GGPR offers spatial data scientists a new method for predicting and exploring complex geographical processes.

- **DOI:** [10.1017/pan.2025.2](https://doi.org/10.1017/pan.2025.2)
- **Abstract:** 
 Building on the availability of geospatial data, improvements in mapping software, and innovations in spatial statistics, political scientists are increasingly taking geography seriously. As we adopt the tools of geographers, we must also consider the methodological challenges they have identified. We focus on the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP)—the idea that the size of aggregate spatial units and the location of their borders affect the empirical results we obtain. We first describe the logic of the MAUP, and then demonstrate the MAUP through simulations, showing MAUP-related inconsistency in regression results in randomly generated and real-world data. We identify MAUP concerns, and best practices, in top journals in political science. We conclude by suggesting how scholars may respond in theoretical and empirical terms to concerns about validity and reliability that arise from the MAUP.

- **Abstract:** The connection between crime and health is profoundly complex – shaped by a constellation of individual, community, and policy-level mechanisms. On the one hand, exposure to crime, contact with law enforcement, and incarceration have all been shown to play a role in a range of deleterious health outcomes, including the prevalence of chronic conditions, infectious diseases, and untreated mental health conditions (Patterson 2013; Schnittker, Massoglia, and Uggen 2012). On the other hand, poor community health – characterized by factors such as inadequate healthcare access, high rates of substance use disorders, and pervasive mental health challenges – can also influence patterns of crime (Burris et al. 2016). Importantly, policies governing access to care, criminal legal practices, housing, and social services also shape crime-health patterns, either perpetuating cycles of crime and poor health or creating opportunities for intervention and community well-being (Braveman, Egerter, and Williams 2011; Cloud 2014). Taken as a whole, these patterns underscore the complexity of the crime – health nexus and highlight the importance of understanding whether and how various mechanisms at the individual, environmental, and policy levels shape these patterns.

- **Abstract:** Large-scale changes in the structure and cellular makeup of the distal lung are a hallmark of pulmonary fibrosis (PF), but the spatial contexts that contribute to disease pathogenesis have remained uncertain. Using image-based spatial transcriptomics, we analyzed the gene expression of 1.6 million cells from 35 unique lungs. Through complementary cell-based and innovative cell-agnostic analyses, we characterized the localization of PF-emergent cell types, established the cellular and molecular basis of classical PF histopathologic features and identified a diversity of distinct molecularly defined spatial niches in control and PF lungs. Using machine learning and trajectory analysis to segment and rank airspaces on a gradient of remodeling severity, we identified compositional and molecular changes associated with progressive distal lung pathology, beginning with alveolar epithelial dysregulation and culminating with changes in macrophage polarization. Together, these results provide a unique, spatially resolved view of PF and establish methods that could be applied to other spatial transcriptomic studies. Xenium spatial transcriptomic profiling of pulmonary fibrosis characterizes cell composition dynamics and histopathological features associated with the disease.

- **Abstract:** Flooding and other natural disasters threaten human life and property worldwide. They can cause significant damage to infrastructure and disrupt economies. Tamil Nadu coast is severely prone to flooding due to land use and climate changes. This research applies geospatial tools and machine learning to improve flood susceptibility mapping across the Tamil Nadu coast in India, using projections of Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) changes under current and future climate change scenarios. To identify flooded areas, the study utilised Google Earth Engine (GEE), Sentinel-1 data, and 12 geospatial datasets from multiple sources. A random forest algorithm was used for LULC change and flood susceptibility mapping. The LULC data are classified for the years 2000, 2010, and 2020, and from the classified data, the LULC for years 2030, 2040, and 2050 are projected for the study. Four future climate scenarios (SSP 126, 245, 370, and 585) were used for the average annual precipitation from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP6). The results showed that the random forest model performed better in classifying LULC and identifying flood-prone areas. From the results, it has been depicted that the risk of flooding will increase across all scenarios over the period of 2000–2100, with some decadal fluctuations. A significant outcome indicates that the percentage of the area transitioning to moderate and very high flood risk consistently rises across all future projections. This study presents a viable method for flood susceptibility mapping based on different climate change scenarios and yields estimates of flood risk, which can provide valuable insights for managing flood risks.
