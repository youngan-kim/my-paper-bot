- **Abstract:** Freshwater ecosystems are increasingly facing major global and local stressors, while monitoring surface water status by regulatory agencies is often limited by financial and political constraints. Citizen science–based approaches with robust quality control and training can support regulatory monitoring and decision-making. Herein, we outline the criteria used to develop a citizen science monitoring program for water quality, based on a standardized methodology designed to support the Agenda 2030 indicator 6.3.2 and the EU’s Water Framework Directive. We explore the evolution of protocols used to ensure data robustness and transferability and examine the utility of contextual information registered by citizen scientists. We present laboratory and field experiments conducted to validate chemical and optical methods. Using the data from more than 80 projects across 4 biogeographical regions, we explore consistencies and differences in seasonal and spatial trends in macronutrient concentrations between regions. Our results indicate that nitrate and phosphate concentrations tend to increase in areas with agricultural intensification and industrial land use. Seasonally, nitrate concentrations reach a maximum in spring and autumn in temperate regions, while phosphate levels are highest in summer and autumn, reaching a minimum in winter. We also found that observations of algal blooms coincided with periods of lower nitrate concentrations. Importantly, data of ecological, chemical, and optical conditions recorded by citizen scientists are being used by local and regional stakeholders in managing freshwater ecosystems. This study reveals the potential for scaling citizen science–based monitoring programs to contribute towards a global assessment of water quality.

- **Abstract:** Water hyacinth (Pontederia crassipes) is an invasive weed that covers a significant portion of Lake Tana. The infestation has an impact on the lake’s ecological and socioeconomic systems. Early detection of the spread of water hyacinth using geospatial techniques is crucial for its effective management and control. The main objective of this study was to examine the spatiotemporal distribution of water hyacinth from 2016 to 2022 using a random forest machine learning model. The study used 16 variables obtained from Sentinel-2A, Sentinel-1 SAR, and SRTM DEM, and a random forest supervised classification model was applied. Seven spectral indices, five spectral bands, two Sentinel-1 SAR bands, and two topographic variables were used in combination to model the spatial distribution of water hyacinth. The model was evaluated using the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient. The findings demonstrated that the overall accuracy ranged from 0.91 to 0.94 and kappa coefficient from 0.88 to 0.92 in the wet season and 0.93 to 0.95 and 0.90 to 0.93 in the dry season, respectively. B11 and B5 (2022), VH, soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), and normalized difference water index (NDWI) (2020), B5 and B12 (2018), and VH and slope (2016) are the highly important variables in the classification. The study found that the spatial coverage of water hyacinth was 686.5 and 650.4 ha (2016), 1,851 and 1,259 ha (2018), 1,396.7 and 1,305.7 ha (2020), and 1,436.5 and 1,216.5 ha (2022) in the wet and dry seasons, respectively. The research findings indicate that variables derived from optical (Sentinel-2A and SRTM) and non-optical (Sentinel-1 SAR) satellite imagery effectively identify water hyacinth and display its spatiotemporal spread using the random forest machine learning algorithm.

## 8. [Milling Machine Fault Diagnosis Using Acoustic Emission and Hybrid Deep Learning with Feature Optimization](https://doi.org/10.3390/app142210404)

- **DOI:** [10.3390/app142210404](https://doi.org/10.3390/app142210404)
- **Abstract:** This paper presents a fault diagnosis technique for milling machines based on acoustic emission (AE) signals and a hybrid deep learning model optimized with a genetic algorithm. Mechanical failures in milling machines, particularly in critical components like cutting tools, gears, and bearings, account for a significant portion of operational breakdowns, leading to unplanned downtime and financial losses. To address this issue, the proposed method first acquires AE signals from the milling machine. AE signals, capturing the dynamic responses of machine components, are transformed into continuous wavelet transform (CWT) scalograms for further analysis. Gaussian filtering is applied to enhance the clarity of these scalograms, effectively reducing noise while maintaining essential features. A convolutional neural network (CNN) based on the VGG16 architecture is utilized for spatial feature extraction, followed by a bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) network to capture the temporal dependencies of the scalograms. The genetic algorithm (GA) is used to optimize feature selection and ensure the selection of the most relevant features to further improve the model’s performance. The optimized features are finally fed into a fully connected (FC) layer of the proposed hybrid model for fault classification. The proposed method achieves an accuracy of 99.6%, significantly outperforming traditional approaches. This method offers a highly accurate and efficient solution for fault detection in milling machines, allowing for more reliable predictive maintenance and operational efficiency in industrial settings.

## 10. [Spatial Economics](https://doi.org/10.14530/se)
- **Authors:** Stephen J. Redding
- **Journal:** Social Science Research Network
- **Date:** 2024-11-01
- **DOI:** [10.14530/se](https://doi.org/10.14530/se)
- **Abstract:** This paper reviews recent research in spatial economics. The field of spatial economics is concerned with the determinants and effects of the location of economic activity in geographic space. It analyses how geographical location shapes the economic activities performed by agents, their interactions with one another, their welfare, and the effects of public policy interventions. Research in this area has benefited from the simultaneous development of new theoretical techniques, new sources of geographic information systems (GIS) data, rapid advances in computing power, machine learning and artificial intelligence, and renewed public policy interest in infrastructure and appropriate policies towards places “left-behind” by globalization and technology. Among the insights from this research are the role of goods and commuting market access in determining location choices; the conditions under which the location of economic activity is characterized by multiple equilibria; the circumstances under which temporary shocks can have permanent effects (hysteresis or path dependence); the heterogeneous and persistent impact of local shocks; the magnitude and spatial decay of agglomeration economics; and the role of both agglomeration forces and endogenous changes in land use in shaping the impact of transport infrastructure improvements.

- **Abstract:** Abstract Building upon prior work, we propose an alternative way to look at the pattern of spatial crime concentration and temporal stability of it. We first identify a high-crime cluster using the sample block groups in New York City by employing a k-means clustering method. We then examine the temporal stability of the high-crime cluster over time. We also longitudinally assess how our high-crime cluster classification is associated with the actual amount of crime while accounting for the measures of social and physical environments. We observed that about 6–12% of total areas are identified to be in the high-crime cluster. We also found that block groups identified to be high-crime cluster in one year are more likely to be that way in the next year. We hope future research may consider using data-driven approaches to expand understanding of spatial and temporal crime patterns.

## 13. [The Universal Neighborhood Effect Averaging in Mobility-Dependent Environmental Exposures](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.4c02464)

- **Date:** 2024-10-03
- **DOI:** [10.1021/acs.est.4c02464](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.4c02464)
- **Abstract:** The neighborhood effect averaging problem (NEAP) is a fundamental statistical phenomenon in mobility-dependent environmental exposures. It suggests that individual environmental exposures tend toward the average exposure in the study area when considering human mobility. However, the universality of the NEAP across various environmental exposures and the mechanisms underlying its occurrence remain unclear. Here, using a large human mobility data set of more than 27 000 individuals in the Chicago Metropolitan Area, we provide robust evidence of the existence of the NEAP in a range of individual environmental exposures, including green spaces, air pollution, healthy food environments, transit accessibility, and crime rates. We also unveil the social and spatial disparities in the NEAP’s influence on individual environmental exposure estimates. To further reveal the mechanisms behind the NEAP, we perform multiscenario analyses based on environmental variation and human mobility simulations. The results reveal that the NEAP is a statistical phenomenon of regression to the mean (RTM) under the constraints of spatial autocorrelation in environmental data. Increasing travel distances and out-of-home durations can intensify and promote the NEAP’s impact, particularly for highly dynamic environmental factors like air pollution. These findings illuminate the complex interplay between human mobility and environmental factors, guiding more effective public health interventions.

## 15. [Mixed-use urban land parcels identification integrating geospatial data and machine learning](https://doi.org/10.1080/10095020.2024.2374996)

- **DOI:** [10.1080/10095020.2024.2374996](https://doi.org/10.1080/10095020.2024.2374996)
- **Abstract:** ABSTRACT Urban land use information is essential for urban planning and sustainable development. However, the increasing prevalence of Mixed-Use Urban Land (MUUL) introduces uncertainty in land use mapping. Due to the compatibility of different human activities within MUUL, identifying MUUL is still a challenge for scholars. In this study, we proposed a novel framework by integrating geographic big data and machine learning to identify it. First, to be consistent with urban planning practices, we delineated mapping units from urban planning map. Second, based on the variability of the spatial pattern of POIs, two indices, the Amount of POI (AP) and the Deviation Index (DI), were developed. Finally, the random forest model was employed. The empirical study in the Jianghan District of Wuhan, China, showed that the MUUL and non-MUUL exhibited significant spatial pattern of POIs separability, the average AP and DI of the MUUL were much larger than those of the non-MUUL. Moreover, the relatively high identification accuracy (Kappa Coefficient (KC) = 0.85, Hellden’s Mean Accuracy (MA) = 0.87) further demonstrated the effectiveness of the developed indices. The proposed framework in this study can reduce the adverse impacts of MUUL on urban land identification by avoiding the MUUL from being incorrectly identified as a single function. Moreover, by extracting MUUL in advance, it can improve the research efficiency by avoiding the application of the segmentation algorithm to all mapping units as in the previous study. Overall, this study provides important references for scholars to increase the accuracy of urban land use identification and allows authorities and policymakers to monitor the dynamics of MUUL that are essential to urban vibrancy. The spatial pattern indices proposed in this study can also be applied to urban land use identification studies as important features.

- **Abstract:** In the era of rapid advancements in artificial intelligence, the geospatial field is experiencing transformative changes. Traditional methods for land cover classification and anomaly detection have often been inconsistent and inaccurate, leading to significant real-world issues such as resource misallocation, unnoticed illegal activities like deforestation, unmonitored topographical changes such as unauthorized constructions, unattended forest fires, and border fence crises, all of which exacerbate climate change and urbanization challenges. This study systematically explores various machine learning (ML) techniques and their application to publicly available geospatial datasets. Specifically, it compares selected Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and other ML models on these datasets to evaluate multiple performance metrics and conduct a comparative analysis. While numerous ML models have been previously employed for land cover classification and anomaly detection, this review seeks to enhance performance metrics and improve classification accuracy. Prior studies have employed techniques such as Random Forest on Sentinel-2 data (Gromny et al., 2019), multiple regression approaches on Landsat data (Wu et al., 2016), and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on OpenStreetMap data (Feldmeyer et al., 2020). Our study introduces the application of advanced models like VGG16, UNet, and Isolation Forest to geospatial datasets, assessing their impact on enhancing land cover classification and anomaly detection. This research not only aims to achieve higher classification accuracy but also contributes to the field by providing insights into the effectiveness of these models and proposing future directions and opportunities.

- **Abstract:** Land degradation from gully erosion poses a significant threat to the Erer watershed in Eastern Ethiopia, particularly due to agricultural activities and resource exploitation. Identifying erosion-prone areas and underlying factors using advanced machine learning algorithms (MLAs) and geospatial analysis is crucial for addressing this problem and prioritizing adaptive and mitigating strategies. However, previous studies have not leveraged machine learning (ML) and GIS-based approaches to generate susceptibility maps identifying these areas and conditioning factors, hindering sustainable watershed management solutions. This study aimed to predict gully erosion susceptibility (GES) and identify underlying areas and factors in the Erer watershed. Four ML models, namely, XGBoost, random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and artificial neural network (ANN), were integrated with geospatial analysis using 22 geoenvironmental predictors and 1,200 inventory points (70% used for training and 30% for testing). Model performance and robustness were validated through the area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, kappa coefficient, F1 score, and logarithmic loss. The relative slope position is most influential, with 100% importance in SVM and RF and 95% importance in XGBoost, while annual rainfall (AR) dominated ANN (100% importance). Notably, XGBoost demonstrated robustness and superior prediction/mapping, achieving an AUC of 0.97, 91% accuracy, 92% precision, and 81% kappa while maintaining a low logloss (0.0394). However, SVM excelled in classifying gully resistant/susceptible areas (97% sensitivity, 98% specificity, and 91% F1 score). The ANN model predicted the most areas with very high gully susceptibility (13.74%), followed by the SVM (11.69%), XGBoost (10.65%), and RF (7.85%) models, while XGBoost identified the most areas with very low susceptibility (70.19%). The ensemble technique was employed to further enhance GES modeling, and it outperformed the individual models, achieving an AUC of 0.99, 93.5% accuracy, 92.5% precision, 97.5% sensitivity, 95.4% specificity, 85.8% kappa, and 94.9% F1 score. This technique also classified the GES of the watershed as 36.48% very low, 26.51% low, 16.24% moderate, 11.55% high, and 9.22% very high. Furthermore, district-level analyses revealed the most susceptible areas, including the Babile, Fedis, Harar, and Meyumuluke districts, with high GES areas of 32.4%, 21.3%, 14.3%, and 13.6%, respectively. This study offers robust and flexible ML models with comprehensive validation metrics to enhance GES modeling and identify gully prone areas and factors, thereby supporting decision-making for sustainable watershed conservation and land degradation prevention.

- **Abstract:** Assessing and understanding the urban scale impacts of extreme climate events is a global necessity. Risks associated with heat, where intra-urban dynamics and rural/urban boundary conditions greatly impact its distribution, are of particular interest as the evolution of climate change and ur-banization persists. Characterizing Urban Heat Island (UHI) effects is dependent on the availability of high-resolution near-surface air temperature maps and a description of the Local Climate Zones (LCZs). This study assesses the applicability of state-of-the-art (SOTA) Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques for UHI detection and characterization. A Geospatial Foundation Model (GFM) is fine-tuned to predict 2 m air temperature at a 1 km resolution for the urban areas of Johannesburg, South Africa, with mean absolute error measures less than 1.5 °C. UHI characterization is further enabled through a Fully Connected Network (FCN) model for LCZs classification for the same region of interest.

- **Abstract:** Flooding is a major natural hazard worldwide, causing catastrophic damage to communities and infrastructure. Due to climate change exacerbating extreme weather events robust flood hazard modeling is crucial to support disaster resilience and adaptation. This study uses multi-sourced geospatial datasets to develop an advanced machine learning framework for flood hazard assessment in the Arambag region of West Bengal, India. The flood inventory was constructed through Sentinel-1 SAR analysis and global flood databases. Fifteen flood conditioning factors related to topography, land cover, soil, rainfall, proximity, and demographics were incorporated. Rigorous training and testing of diverse machine learning models, including RF, AdaBoost, rFerns, XGB, DeepBoost, GBM, SDA, BAM, monmlp, and MARS algorithms, were undertaken for categorical flood hazard mapping. Model optimization was achieved through statistical feature selection techniques. Accuracy metrics and advanced model interpretability methods like SHAP and Boruta were implemented to evaluate predictive performance. According to the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), the prediction accuracy of the models performed was around > 80%. RF achieves an AUC of 0.847 at resampling factor 5, indicating strong discriminative performance. AdaBoost also consistently exhibits good discriminative ability, with AUC values of 0.839 at resampling factor 10. Boruta and SHAP analysis indicated precipitation and elevation as factors most significantly contributing to flood hazard assessment in the study area. Most of the machine learning models pointed out southern portions of the study area as highly susceptible areas. On average, from 17.2 to 18.6% of the study area is highly susceptible to flood hazards. In the feature selection analysis, various nature-inspired algorithms identified the selected input parameters for flood hazard assessment, i.e., elevation, precipitation, distance to rivers, TWI, geomorphology, lithology, TRI, slope, soil type, curvature, NDVI, distance to roads, and gMIS. As per the Boruta and SHAP analyses, it was found that elevation, precipitation, and distance to rivers play the most crucial roles in the decision-making process for flood hazard assessment. The results indicated that the majority of the building footprints (15.27%) are at high and very high risk, followed by those at very low risk (43.80%), low risk (24.30%), and moderate risk (16.63%). Similarly, the cropland area affected by flooding in this region is categorized into five risk classes: very high (16.85%), high (17.28%), moderate (16.07%), low (16.51%), and very low (33.29%). However, this interdisciplinary study contributes significantly towards hydraulic and hydrological modeling for flood hazard management.

- **Abstract:** 
 We develop a tractable quantitative framework for modelling the rich patterns of spatial mobility observed in smartphone data. We show that travel is frequently undertaken as part of a travel itinerary, defined as a journey starting and ending at home that can include more than one intermediate stop on a given day. We show that these travel itineraries provide microfoundations for consumption externalities and generate both complementarity and substitutability between locations. We show that the consumption externalities implied by travel itineraries are central to matching quasi-experimental evidence from the shift to WFH. We find that these consumption externalities are key drivers of the agglomeration of economic activity in central cities and shape the relative welfare gains from alternative transport improvements in favor of investments in central cities.

- **DOI:** 10.1080/15481603.2025.2533487
- **Abstract:** ABSTRACT Wheat production is crucial in global food security and sustainable development, especially in severe global climate change, frequent extreme weather events, and significant population growth worldwide. A deeper understanding of spatial variation in wheat production and its determining factors is essential for implementing different cultivation practices, water and fertilizer management, and adaptive variety selection across different regions. However, existing methods primarily focused on identifying single-variable factors while lacking geographical spatial characteristics, which may lead to an incomplete exploration of spatial disparities in wheat production, predictions, and responses to changes in determining factors. This study develops a geospatial machine learning model by integrating spatial autocorrelation, spatial stratified heterogeneity, and decision tree to identify spatial disparities and their determinants of wheat production. The model is applied to wheat production analysis in Australia, the world’s 5th (2022) wheat-producing country. First, a spatial autocorrelation method is employed to identify the hotspot area of wheat production in Australia. Next, the geographically optimal zones-based heterogeneity (GOZH) model, an integration of spatial stratified heterogeneity and decision tree learning models, is used to identify determinants and their interactions on spatial disparities of wheat production. Finally, the developed geospatial machine learning model is evaluated by comparing its effectiveness with the commonly used geographical detector model. The results demonstrate pronounced spatial heterogeneity in Australian wheat production driven by environmental, climatic, and soil factors and their interactions. Identifying these spatial determinants enables more efficient crop management – such as targeted sub – regional practices, climate – adaptive variety selection, and soil health strategies – thereby supporting food security and sustainable agricultural systems.

- **DOI:** 10.3390/app15063361
- **Abstract:** The increasing cost of energy and the prevalence of electricity theft pose significant financial and operational challenges for energy providers. Traditional fraud detection methods often fail to identify sophisticated unauthorized consumption, particularly in non-smart-grid environments. This study proposes an advanced machine learning-based methodology for detecting energy fraud, leveraging real-world data from energy distribution networks. This approach integrates multiple machine learning models—k-nearest neighbors (kNN), decision trees, random forest, and artificial neural networks (ANNs)—to improve detection accuracy and efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate an 89.5% fraud detection accuracy, significantly outperforming conventional methods. Furthermore, the implementation of this model led to an estimated financial loss reduction of EUR 45,200. By analyzing historical consumption patterns, anomaly detection techniques, and geospatial data, the proposed system enhances fraud detection capabilities across both smart and non-smart grids. Future research will focus on real-time detection, scalability, and the integration of external data sources to further refine predictive accuracy.

- **Journal:** Geographical Analysis
- **Authors:** Zhenzhi Jiao, Ran Tao
- **Pub Date:** 2025-03-10
- **DOI:** 10.1111/gean.12423
- **Abstract:** This study proposes a new spatial machine‐learning model called geographical Gaussian process regression (GGPR). GGPR is extended from Gaussian process regression (GPR) by adopting the principle of spatial similarity for calibration, and it is designed to conduct spatial prediction and exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA). GGPR addresses several key challenges in spatial machine learning. First, as a probabilistic model, GGPR avoids the conflict between spatial autocorrelation and the assumption of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), thus enhancing the model's objectivity and reliability in spatial prediction. Second, GGPR is suitable for small‐sample prediction, a task that most existing models struggle with. Finally, when integrated with GeoShapley, GGPR is an explainable model that can measure spatial effects and explain the outcomes. Evaluated on two distinct datasets, GGPR demonstrates superior predictive performance compared to other popular machine‐learning models across various sampling ratios, with its advantage becoming especially evident with smaller sample sizes. As an ESDA model, GGPR demonstrates enhanced accuracy, better computational efficiency, and a comparable ability to measure spatial effects against both multiscale geographically weighted regression and geographical random forests. In short, GGPR offers spatial data scientists a new method for predicting and exploring complex geographical processes.

- **Abstract:** 
 Building on the availability of geospatial data, improvements in mapping software, and innovations in spatial statistics, political scientists are increasingly taking geography seriously. As we adopt the tools of geographers, we must also consider the methodological challenges they have identified. We focus on the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP)—the idea that the size of aggregate spatial units and the location of their borders affect the empirical results we obtain. We first describe the logic of the MAUP, and then demonstrate the MAUP through simulations, showing MAUP-related inconsistency in regression results in randomly generated and real-world data. We identify MAUP concerns, and best practices, in top journals in political science. We conclude by suggesting how scholars may respond in theoretical and empirical terms to concerns about validity and reliability that arise from the MAUP.

- **Abstract:** Flooding and other natural disasters threaten human life and property worldwide. They can cause significant damage to infrastructure and disrupt economies. Tamil Nadu coast is severely prone to flooding due to land use and climate changes. This research applies geospatial tools and machine learning to improve flood susceptibility mapping across the Tamil Nadu coast in India, using projections of Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) changes under current and future climate change scenarios. To identify flooded areas, the study utilised Google Earth Engine (GEE), Sentinel-1 data, and 12 geospatial datasets from multiple sources. A random forest algorithm was used for LULC change and flood susceptibility mapping. The LULC data are classified for the years 2000, 2010, and 2020, and from the classified data, the LULC for years 2030, 2040, and 2050 are projected for the study. Four future climate scenarios (SSP 126, 245, 370, and 585) were used for the average annual precipitation from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP6). The results showed that the random forest model performed better in classifying LULC and identifying flood-prone areas. From the results, it has been depicted that the risk of flooding will increase across all scenarios over the period of 2000–2100, with some decadal fluctuations. A significant outcome indicates that the percentage of the area transitioning to moderate and very high flood risk consistently rises across all future projections. This study presents a viable method for flood susceptibility mapping based on different climate change scenarios and yields estimates of flood risk, which can provide valuable insights for managing flood risks.

- **Abstract:** Freshwater ecosystems are increasingly facing major global and local stressors, while monitoring surface water status by regulatory agencies is often limited by financial and political constraints. Citizen science–based approaches with robust quality control and training can support regulatory monitoring and decision-making. Herein, we outline the criteria used to develop a citizen science monitoring program for water quality, based on a standardized methodology designed to support the Agenda 2030 indicator 6.3.2 and the EU’s Water Framework Directive. We explore the evolution of protocols used to ensure data robustness and transferability and examine the utility of contextual information registered by citizen scientists. We present laboratory and field experiments conducted to validate chemical and optical methods. Using the data from more than 80 projects across 4 biogeographical regions, we explore consistencies and differences in seasonal and spatial trends in macronutrient concentrations between regions. Our results indicate that nitrate and phosphate concentrations tend to increase in areas with agricultural intensification and industrial land use. Seasonally, nitrate concentrations reach a maximum in spring and autumn in temperate regions, while phosphate levels are highest in summer and autumn, reaching a minimum in winter. We also found that observations of algal blooms coincided with periods of lower nitrate concentrations. Importantly, data of ecological, chemical, and optical conditions recorded by citizen scientists are being used by local and regional stakeholders in managing freshwater ecosystems. This study reveals the potential for scaling citizen science–based monitoring programs to contribute towards a global assessment of water quality.

- **Abstract:** Water hyacinth (Pontederia crassipes) is an invasive weed that covers a significant portion of Lake Tana. The infestation has an impact on the lake’s ecological and socioeconomic systems. Early detection of the spread of water hyacinth using geospatial techniques is crucial for its effective management and control. The main objective of this study was to examine the spatiotemporal distribution of water hyacinth from 2016 to 2022 using a random forest machine learning model. The study used 16 variables obtained from Sentinel-2A, Sentinel-1 SAR, and SRTM DEM, and a random forest supervised classification model was applied. Seven spectral indices, five spectral bands, two Sentinel-1 SAR bands, and two topographic variables were used in combination to model the spatial distribution of water hyacinth. The model was evaluated using the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient. The findings demonstrated that the overall accuracy ranged from 0.91 to 0.94 and kappa coefficient from 0.88 to 0.92 in the wet season and 0.93 to 0.95 and 0.90 to 0.93 in the dry season, respectively. B11 and B5 (2022), VH, soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), and normalized difference water index (NDWI) (2020), B5 and B12 (2018), and VH and slope (2016) are the highly important variables in the classification. The study found that the spatial coverage of water hyacinth was 686.5 and 650.4 ha (2016), 1,851 and 1,259 ha (2018), 1,396.7 and 1,305.7 ha (2020), and 1,436.5 and 1,216.5 ha (2022) in the wet and dry seasons, respectively. The research findings indicate that variables derived from optical (Sentinel-2A and SRTM) and non-optical (Sentinel-1 SAR) satellite imagery effectively identify water hyacinth and display its spatiotemporal spread using the random forest machine learning algorithm.

- **Pub Date:** 2024-11-12
- **DOI:** 10.3390/app142210404
- **Abstract:** This paper presents a fault diagnosis technique for milling machines based on acoustic emission (AE) signals and a hybrid deep learning model optimized with a genetic algorithm. Mechanical failures in milling machines, particularly in critical components like cutting tools, gears, and bearings, account for a significant portion of operational breakdowns, leading to unplanned downtime and financial losses. To address this issue, the proposed method first acquires AE signals from the milling machine. AE signals, capturing the dynamic responses of machine components, are transformed into continuous wavelet transform (CWT) scalograms for further analysis. Gaussian filtering is applied to enhance the clarity of these scalograms, effectively reducing noise while maintaining essential features. A convolutional neural network (CNN) based on the VGG16 architecture is utilized for spatial feature extraction, followed by a bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) network to capture the temporal dependencies of the scalograms. The genetic algorithm (GA) is used to optimize feature selection and ensure the selection of the most relevant features to further improve the model’s performance. The optimized features are finally fed into a fully connected (FC) layer of the proposed hybrid model for fault classification. The proposed method achieves an accuracy of 99.6%, significantly outperforming traditional approaches. This method offers a highly accurate and efficient solution for fault detection in milling machines, allowing for more reliable predictive maintenance and operational efficiency in industrial settings.

- **Pub Date:** 2024-11-01
- **DOI:** 10.14530/se
- **Abstract:** This paper reviews recent research in spatial economics. The field of spatial economics is concerned with the determinants and effects of the location of economic activity in geographic space. It analyses how geographical location shapes the economic activities performed by agents, their interactions with one another, their welfare, and the effects of public policy interventions. Research in this area has benefited from the simultaneous development of new theoretical techniques, new sources of geographic information systems (GIS) data, rapid advances in computing power, machine learning and artificial intelligence, and renewed public policy interest in infrastructure and appropriate policies towards places “left-behind” by globalization and technology. Among the insights from this research are the role of goods and commuting market access in determining location choices; the conditions under which the location of economic activity is characterized by multiple equilibria; the circumstances under which temporary shocks can have permanent effects (hysteresis or path dependence); the heterogeneous and persistent impact of local shocks; the magnitude and spatial decay of agglomeration economics; and the role of both agglomeration forces and endogenous changes in land use in shaping the impact of transport infrastructure improvements.

- **Journal:** Geographical Analysis
- **Authors:** Lan Qing Zhao, S. Dragićević, Shivanand Balram, Liliana Perez
- **Pub Date:** 2025-03-27
- **DOI:** 10.1111/gean.70004
- **Abstract:** The analytical hierarchy process (AHP) is a widely used approach and a decision rule to derive criteria weights in geographic information system‐based multi‐criteria evaluation (GIS‐MCE). However, one limitation of the AHP method is that it constrains the number of criteria that can be meaningfully weighted to typically seven to nine criteria. Recently, machine learning (ML) techniques have emerged as a compelling alternative for deriving criteria weights. This research aims to assess the capabilities of ML‐MCE in handling a larger number of criteria and is specifically applied to a case study of urban suitability analysis. The random forest (RF) ML technique is used to evaluate the ability of the MCE method to handle up to 27 criteria. Geospatial data from the Metro Vancouver Region, Canada, are used, with the criteria subdivided into 11 groups starting with the most basic seven criteria and incrementally adding two new criteria per group. The results indicate the RF‐ML approach can manage a larger number of criteria compared to the traditional AHP approach, with 15 criteria providing a meaningful upper threshold, demonstrating its potential to accommodate a wider range of stakeholder preferences for complex urban suitability analysis contexts.

- **DOI:** 10.1080/07418825.2024.2401938
- **Abstract:** Abstract Building upon prior work, we propose an alternative way to look at the pattern of spatial crime concentration and temporal stability of it. We first identify a high-crime cluster using the sample block groups in New York City by employing a k-means clustering method. We then examine the temporal stability of the high-crime cluster over time. We also longitudinally assess how our high-crime cluster classification is associated with the actual amount of crime while accounting for the measures of social and physical environments. We observed that about 6–12% of total areas are identified to be in the high-crime cluster. We also found that block groups identified to be high-crime cluster in one year are more likely to be that way in the next year. We hope future research may consider using data-driven approaches to expand understanding of spatial and temporal crime patterns.

- **Pub Date:** 2024-10-03
- **DOI:** 10.1021/acs.est.4c02464
- **Abstract:** The neighborhood effect averaging problem (NEAP) is a fundamental statistical phenomenon in mobility-dependent environmental exposures. It suggests that individual environmental exposures tend toward the average exposure in the study area when considering human mobility. However, the universality of the NEAP across various environmental exposures and the mechanisms underlying its occurrence remain unclear. Here, using a large human mobility data set of more than 27 000 individuals in the Chicago Metropolitan Area, we provide robust evidence of the existence of the NEAP in a range of individual environmental exposures, including green spaces, air pollution, healthy food environments, transit accessibility, and crime rates. We also unveil the social and spatial disparities in the NEAP’s influence on individual environmental exposure estimates. To further reveal the mechanisms behind the NEAP, we perform multiscenario analyses based on environmental variation and human mobility simulations. The results reveal that the NEAP is a statistical phenomenon of regression to the mean (RTM) under the constraints of spatial autocorrelation in environmental data. Increasing travel distances and out-of-home durations can intensify and promote the NEAP’s impact, particularly for highly dynamic environmental factors like air pollution. These findings illuminate the complex interplay between human mobility and environmental factors, guiding more effective public health interventions.

- **DOI:** 10.1080/10095020.2024.2374996
- **Abstract:** ABSTRACT Urban land use information is essential for urban planning and sustainable development. However, the increasing prevalence of Mixed-Use Urban Land (MUUL) introduces uncertainty in land use mapping. Due to the compatibility of different human activities within MUUL, identifying MUUL is still a challenge for scholars. In this study, we proposed a novel framework by integrating geographic big data and machine learning to identify it. First, to be consistent with urban planning practices, we delineated mapping units from urban planning map. Second, based on the variability of the spatial pattern of POIs, two indices, the Amount of POI (AP) and the Deviation Index (DI), were developed. Finally, the random forest model was employed. The empirical study in the Jianghan District of Wuhan, China, showed that the MUUL and non-MUUL exhibited significant spatial pattern of POIs separability, the average AP and DI of the MUUL were much larger than those of the non-MUUL. Moreover, the relatively high identification accuracy (Kappa Coefficient (KC) = 0.85, Hellden’s Mean Accuracy (MA) = 0.87) further demonstrated the effectiveness of the developed indices. The proposed framework in this study can reduce the adverse impacts of MUUL on urban land identification by avoiding the MUUL from being incorrectly identified as a single function. Moreover, by extracting MUUL in advance, it can improve the research efficiency by avoiding the application of the segmentation algorithm to all mapping units as in the previous study. Overall, this study provides important references for scholars to increase the accuracy of urban land use identification and allows authorities and policymakers to monitor the dynamics of MUUL that are essential to urban vibrancy. The spatial pattern indices proposed in this study can also be applied to urban land use identification studies as important features.

- **Abstract:** In the era of rapid advancements in artificial intelligence, the geospatial field is experiencing transformative changes. Traditional methods for land cover classification and anomaly detection have often been inconsistent and inaccurate, leading to significant real-world issues such as resource misallocation, unnoticed illegal activities like deforestation, unmonitored topographical changes such as unauthorized constructions, unattended forest fires, and border fence crises, all of which exacerbate climate change and urbanization challenges. This study systematically explores various machine learning (ML) techniques and their application to publicly available geospatial datasets. Specifically, it compares selected Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and other ML models on these datasets to evaluate multiple performance metrics and conduct a comparative analysis. While numerous ML models have been previously employed for land cover classification and anomaly detection, this review seeks to enhance performance metrics and improve classification accuracy. Prior studies have employed techniques such as Random Forest on Sentinel-2 data (Gromny et al., 2019), multiple regression approaches on Landsat data (Wu et al., 2016), and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on OpenStreetMap data (Feldmeyer et al., 2020). Our study introduces the application of advanced models like VGG16, UNet, and Isolation Forest to geospatial datasets, assessing their impact on enhancing land cover classification and anomaly detection. This research not only aims to achieve higher classification accuracy but also contributes to the field by providing insights into the effectiveness of these models and proposing future directions and opportunities.

- **Abstract:** Land degradation from gully erosion poses a significant threat to the Erer watershed in Eastern Ethiopia, particularly due to agricultural activities and resource exploitation. Identifying erosion-prone areas and underlying factors using advanced machine learning algorithms (MLAs) and geospatial analysis is crucial for addressing this problem and prioritizing adaptive and mitigating strategies. However, previous studies have not leveraged machine learning (ML) and GIS-based approaches to generate susceptibility maps identifying these areas and conditioning factors, hindering sustainable watershed management solutions. This study aimed to predict gully erosion susceptibility (GES) and identify underlying areas and factors in the Erer watershed. Four ML models, namely, XGBoost, random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and artificial neural network (ANN), were integrated with geospatial analysis using 22 geoenvironmental predictors and 1,200 inventory points (70% used for training and 30% for testing). Model performance and robustness were validated through the area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, kappa coefficient, F1 score, and logarithmic loss. The relative slope position is most influential, with 100% importance in SVM and RF and 95% importance in XGBoost, while annual rainfall (AR) dominated ANN (100% importance). Notably, XGBoost demonstrated robustness and superior prediction/mapping, achieving an AUC of 0.97, 91% accuracy, 92% precision, and 81% kappa while maintaining a low logloss (0.0394). However, SVM excelled in classifying gully resistant/susceptible areas (97% sensitivity, 98% specificity, and 91% F1 score). The ANN model predicted the most areas with very high gully susceptibility (13.74%), followed by the SVM (11.69%), XGBoost (10.65%), and RF (7.85%) models, while XGBoost identified the most areas with very low susceptibility (70.19%). The ensemble technique was employed to further enhance GES modeling, and it outperformed the individual models, achieving an AUC of 0.99, 93.5% accuracy, 92.5% precision, 97.5% sensitivity, 95.4% specificity, 85.8% kappa, and 94.9% F1 score. This technique also classified the GES of the watershed as 36.48% very low, 26.51% low, 16.24% moderate, 11.55% high, and 9.22% very high. Furthermore, district-level analyses revealed the most susceptible areas, including the Babile, Fedis, Harar, and Meyumuluke districts, with high GES areas of 32.4%, 21.3%, 14.3%, and 13.6%, respectively. This study offers robust and flexible ML models with comprehensive validation metrics to enhance GES modeling and identify gully prone areas and factors, thereby supporting decision-making for sustainable watershed conservation and land degradation prevention.

- **Abstract:** Flooding is a major natural hazard worldwide, causing catastrophic damage to communities and infrastructure. Due to climate change exacerbating extreme weather events robust flood hazard modeling is crucial to support disaster resilience and adaptation. This study uses multi-sourced geospatial datasets to develop an advanced machine learning framework for flood hazard assessment in the Arambag region of West Bengal, India. The flood inventory was constructed through Sentinel-1 SAR analysis and global flood databases. Fifteen flood conditioning factors related to topography, land cover, soil, rainfall, proximity, and demographics were incorporated. Rigorous training and testing of diverse machine learning models, including RF, AdaBoost, rFerns, XGB, DeepBoost, GBM, SDA, BAM, monmlp, and MARS algorithms, were undertaken for categorical flood hazard mapping. Model optimization was achieved through statistical feature selection techniques. Accuracy metrics and advanced model interpretability methods like SHAP and Boruta were implemented to evaluate predictive performance. According to the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), the prediction accuracy of the models performed was around > 80%. RF achieves an AUC of 0.847 at resampling factor 5, indicating strong discriminative performance. AdaBoost also consistently exhibits good discriminative ability, with AUC values of 0.839 at resampling factor 10. Boruta and SHAP analysis indicated precipitation and elevation as factors most significantly contributing to flood hazard assessment in the study area. Most of the machine learning models pointed out southern portions of the study area as highly susceptible areas. On average, from 17.2 to 18.6% of the study area is highly susceptible to flood hazards. In the feature selection analysis, various nature-inspired algorithms identified the selected input parameters for flood hazard assessment, i.e., elevation, precipitation, distance to rivers, TWI, geomorphology, lithology, TRI, slope, soil type, curvature, NDVI, distance to roads, and gMIS. As per the Boruta and SHAP analyses, it was found that elevation, precipitation, and distance to rivers play the most crucial roles in the decision-making process for flood hazard assessment. The results indicated that the majority of the building footprints (15.27%) are at high and very high risk, followed by those at very low risk (43.80%), low risk (24.30%), and moderate risk (16.63%). Similarly, the cropland area affected by flooding in this region is categorized into five risk classes: very high (16.85%), high (17.28%), moderate (16.07%), low (16.51%), and very low (33.29%). However, this interdisciplinary study contributes significantly towards hydraulic and hydrological modeling for flood hazard management.

- **Abstract:** As the world's population continues to surge, the earth's ecological limits are being stretched. Some of the major threats to habitability stem from the pursuit of perpetual economic growth, and power struggles among nations, leading to ecological and social destruction and ongoing crises. A shift toward wiser earth management could enhance habitability through collective strategies within a global political framework. Key components include adopting renewable energy, limiting ecological footprints, fostering clean prosperity, and promoting peaceful coexistence among nations. Our survival hinges on embracing cooperative security and transitioning toward a collective approach to governance, redirecting resources from militarization toward protection of the global commons. This necessitates international collaboration and democratic participation across temporal and spatial scales, facilitated by a UN-led framework. We believe science should play a crucial role in developing common strategies for a viable world, contingent upon decision-makers prioritizing global cooperation over narrow short-term self-interest. Scientists and policymakers can work together, creating more viable futures through international cooperation and a move away from violence. Moreover, citizens have an important role to play by changing their lifestyles and supporting measures mentioned in this paper.

- **Abstract:** With average temperature ranging from −20°C at the North Pole to 30°C at the Equator and with global warming expected to reach 1.4°C to 4.5°C by the year 2100, it is clear that climate change will have vastly different effects across the globe. Given the abundance of land in northern latitudes, if population and economic activity could freely move across space, the economic cost of global warming would be greatly reduced. However, spatial frictions are real: migrants face barriers, trade and transportation are costly, physical infrastructure is not footloose, and knowledge embedded in clusters of economic activity diffuses only imperfectly. Thus, the economic cost of climate change is intimately connected to these spatial frictions. Building on earlier integrated assessment models (IAMs) that largely ignored space, in the past decade there has been significant progress in developing dynamic spatial integrated assessment models (S-IAMs) aimed at providing a more realistic evaluation of the economic cost of climate change, both locally and globally. This review discusses this progress and provides a guide for future work in this area.

- **DOI:** 10.1080/15481603.2025.2460513
- **Abstract:** ABSTRACT Recent geospatial machine learning studies have shown that the results of model evaluation via cross-validation (CV) are strongly affected by the dissimilarity between the sample data and the prediction locations. In this paper, we propose a method to quantify such a dissimilarity in the interval 0 to 100% and from the perspective of the data feature space. The proposed method is based on adversarial validation, which is an approach that can check whether sample data and prediction locations can be separated with a binary classifier. The proposed method is called dissimilarity quantification by adversarial validation (DAV). To study the effectiveness and generality of DAV, we tested it on a series of experiments based on both synthetic and real datasets and with gradually increasing dissimilarities. Results show that DAV effectively quantified dissimilarity across the entire range of values. Next to this, we studied how dissimilarity affects CV methods’ evaluations by comparing the results of random CV method (RDM-CV) and of two geospatial CV methods, namely, block and spatial+ CV (BLK-CV and SP-CV). Our results showed the evaluations follow similar patterns in all datasets and predictions: when dissimilarity is low (usually lower than 30%), RDM-CV provides the most accurate evaluation results. As dissimilarity increases, geospatial CV methods, especially SP-CV, become more and more accurate and even outperform RDM-CV. When dissimilarity is high ($ \ge \!90\% $≥90%), no CV method provides accurate evaluations. These results show the importance of considering feature space dissimilarity when working with geospatial machine learning predictions and can help researchers and practitioners to select more suitable CV methods for evaluating their predictions.

- **Abstract:** With the rapid development of information technology, multiple time series forecasting, which is typical of traffic flow forecasting, has become increasingly important in big data analysis. As the cornerstone of intelligent transportation system, traffic flow forecasting has important scientific research value and practical application value for urban traffic operation scheduling, quality and efficiency improvement of logistics transportation industry and public travel planning. Traffic flow prediction is always an important task of intelligent transportation system. Due to the complex temporal and spatial dependence of traffic flow sequence, it is very challenging to construct accurate traffic flow prediction in its ring neural network, graph network and Transformer model. Much of the existing work is based on very good models. Considering the advantages of convolutional networks, such as high computational efficiency and strong feature extraction ability, a traffic flow prediction model based on multi-view spatiotemporal convolution is proposed.

- **Abstract:** Assessing and understanding the urban scale impacts of extreme climate events is a global necessity. Risks associated with heat, where intra-urban dynamics and rural/urban boundary conditions greatly impact its distribution, are of particular interest as the evolution of climate change and ur-banization persists. Characterizing Urban Heat Island (UHI) effects is dependent on the availability of high-resolution near-surface air temperature maps and a description of the Local Climate Zones (LCZs). This study assesses the applicability of state-of-the-art (SOTA) Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques for UHI detection and characterization. A Geospatial Foundation Model (GFM) is fine-tuned to predict 2 m air temperature at a 1 km resolution for the urban areas of Johannesburg, South Africa, with mean absolute error measures less than 1.5 °C. UHI characterization is further enabled through a Fully Connected Network (FCN) model for LCZs classification for the same region of interest.

- **Abstract:** The spatial deployment of urban public electric vehicle charging stations (PEVCSs) plays a pivotal role in the widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs). However, with the rapid advancements in EV technology and battery capabilities, substantial improvements in both range and charging efficiency have emerged and are expected to continue experiencing sustained growth. This situation underscores the urgent necessity of establishing dynamic metrics to reconsider the existing static charging infrastructure, aiming to ameliorate the current severe spatial imbalances and supply–demand disparities encountered in the deployment of PEVCSs. In this study, we harnessed and analyzed 84,152 sets of authentic data, fine-tuned through geospatial-aggregation technology, and ensured anonymity. Our findings bridged users’ residential and occupational patterns with their charging propensities. Comparing these with the spatial distribution of current charging stations revealed that Beijing and Shenzhen’s infrastructure aligned with the cities' economic, educational, and residential zones, epitomizing a synergy in provisioning. However, certain areas experienced either a demand–supply imbalance or an oversupply. To address these challenges, we introduced the Charging Access Reachability Index (CARI) using machine learning techniques. This dynamic metric serves as a tool for quantifying the effective coverage range of charging facilities. Its adaptive threshold holds potential as a crucial indicator enabling the dynamic transition towards more efficient and resilient charging infrastructure.

- **DOI:** 10.1007/s13201-024-02162-x
- **Abstract:** Groundwater resources in Morocco often face sustainability challenges due to increased exploitation and climate change. Specifically, the Al-Haouz-Mejjate groundwater in the Marrakesh region is faced with overexploitation and insufficient recharge. However, the complex subsurface geometries hamper hydrogeological modeling, characterization, and effective management. Reliably estimating aquifer substrate topography is critical for groundwater models but is challenged by limited direct measurements. This study develops nonlinear machine learning models to infer substrate depths by fusing sparse borehole logs with regional geospatial data. A Gaussian process regression approach provided robust holistic mapping, leveraging flexibility, and uncertainty quantification. Supplementary neural network architectures focus on isolating specific variable relationships, like surface elevation–substrate. Model accuracy exceeded 0.8 R-squared against validation boreholes. Spatial visualizations confirmed consistency across landscape transects. Elevation and piezometric data proved most predictive, though multivariate inputs were required for the lowest errors. The results highlight the power of statistical learning to extract meaningful patterns from disparate hydrological data. However, model opacity and the need for broader training datasets remain barriers. Overall, the work demonstrates advanced machine learning as a promising avenue for illuminating complex aquifer geometries essential for sustainability. Hybrid approaches that use both data-driven and physics-based methods can help solve long-standing problems with hydrogeological characterization.

- **DOI:** 10.1109/MGRS.2023.3343968
- **Abstract:** Urban studies require a rich set of information sources and techniques that enable a comprehensive depiction of urban environments. Remote sensing captures physical characteristics of urban landscapes, while social sensing collects data from social media and digital devices to reflect human activities. The combination of remote sensing and social sensing has been employed to investigate urban environments, urban dynamics, and the well-being of city residents. This review explores leading ideas and methodologies of the synergy between remote sensing and social sensing in a broad context of urban studies. The synergy involves leveraging the benefits of remote sensing and social sensing to gain a deeper understanding of urban characteristics than can be acquired through any single sensing approach. Two types of synergy are identified, namely, “transfer-based synergy” and “integration-based synergy.” The former transfers ideas and techniques between remote sensing and social sensing based on their similarity. The latter integrates these sensing ways based on their complementary advantages. The motivations and methods are summarized to show how such synergy is suited for investigating the complex nature of urban systems. Typical applications of the synergy include land use and functional zone mapping, special land use identification, estimation of natural and socioeconomic elements, and emergency response. We also identify data quality issues, refinement of methodologies, and expansion of applications that still pose challenges and are worth future research. This review lays a foundation for synergizing remote sensing and social sensing, offering researchers guidance to reexamine and reconceptualize the city from multiple sensing perspectives.

- **DOI:** 10.30574/wjaets.2025.16.1.1232
- **Abstract:** One of the biggest hydrological hazards in Sub-Saharan Africa is flooding, which is exacerbated by increasing rainfall, inadequate drainage systems, and growing urbanization. In Nigeria, fragmented datasets and inadequate methodological integration continue to limit the ability to map flood susceptibility in a spatially detailed manner. This work presents a hybrid framework that creates interpretable and highly accurate flood susceptibility models for two physiographically distinct regions: Ile-Ife (inland uplands) and Ilaje (coastal lowlands) by combining the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) with the Random Forest (RF) classifier. For Ilaje and Ile-Ife, a total of 43,825 and 8,632 spatial sample points were produced. In order to create a composite Flood Susceptibility Index (FSI), four flood-related predictors elevation, slope, rainfall, and distance to river were normalized and weighted using AHP. To train RF models for each region, the FSI was reclassified into three risk categories. F1-scores, precision, recall, and confusion matrices were used to assess the model’s performance. According to the results, Ilaje and Ile-Ife had classification accuracy rates of 98% and 97%, respectively. In both areas, rainfall and river proximity were the most important predictors, whereas the complexity of the terrain affected the patterns of susceptibility. The AHP-RF framework proved to be highly transparent and dependable, providing a scalable flood risk zoning tool, especially in settings with limited data. This work promotes interpretable geospatial modeling for disaster risk reduction by combining machine learning and expert judgment. The results provide a replicable model for climate adaptation in flood-prone areas of Sub-Saharan Africa and support the incorporation of physiographically informed flood planning into policy frameworks.

- **Abstract:** This paper employs machine learning and space syntax to classify villages, revealing implicit formation and development patterns in their spatial layouts. The study addresses village classification in Jilin Province from micro and macro perspectives. At the macro level, we present the classification method for villages based on geospatial distribution features (CVGD).We analyze the geographic distribution of villages and utilize village density for classification, effectively portraying the spatial distribution characteristics of villages. At the micro level, we propose the classification method for villages based on spatial structural features (CVSS). We use space syntax to extract spatial features of villages. Representative features chosen through comparative analysis serve as input variables in clustering algorithms, classifying villages based on high-dimensional data to explore their spatial traits. The paper summarizes village spatial characteristics from different classifications and studies how geographic factors affect village structure. It aims to offer potentially valuable theoretical insights for rural development.

- **Abstract:** We assess which waters the Clean Water Act protects and how Supreme Court and White House rules change this regulation. We train a deep learning model using aerial imagery and geophysical data to predict 150,000 jurisdictional determinations from the Army Corps of Engineers, each deciding regulation for one water resource. Under a 2006 Supreme Court ruling, the Clean Water Act protects two-thirds of US streams and more than half of wetlands; under a 2020 White House rule, it protects less than half of streams and a fourth of wetlands, implying deregulation of 690,000 stream miles, 35 million wetland acres, and 30% of waters around drinking-water sources. Our framework can support permitting, policy design, and use of machine learning in regulatory implementation problems. Editor’s summary The Clean Water Act is a defining piece of environmental legislation in the US, but the waters that it protects from pollution have never been clearly defined. Greenhill et al. developed a machine learning model that uses geospatial data to predict which waters are covered by the Clean Water Act and trained and tested the model with jurisdictional determinations from the US Army Corps of Engineers. This work provides an estimate of the extent of protected waterways, as well as an understanding of the effects of Supreme Court and White House rules that have reinterpreted or changed the regulation. For a subset of sites with high predictive accuracy, their model can also act as decision support tool to expedite permitting. —Bianca Lopez A machine learning model improves estimates of the extent of protection by the US Clean Water Act and the effects of deregulation.

- **Abstract:** Highly multiplexed protein imaging is emerging as a potent technique for analyzing protein distribution within cells and tissues in their native context. However, existing cell annotation methods utilizing high-plex spatial proteomics data are resource intensive and necessitate iterative expert input, thereby constraining their scalability and practicality for extensive datasets. We introduce MAPS (Machine learning for Analysis of Proteomics in Spatial biology), a machine learning approach facilitating rapid and precise cell type identification with human-level accuracy from spatial proteomics data. Validated on multiple in-house and publicly available MIBI and CODEX datasets, MAPS outperforms current annotation techniques in terms of speed and accuracy, achieving pathologist-level precision even for typically challenging cell types, including tumor cells of immune origin. By democratizing rapidly deployable and scalable machine learning annotation, MAPS holds significant potential to expedite advances in tissue biology and disease comprehension. Current cell annotation methods using high-plex spatial proteomics data are resource intensive and demand iterative expert input. Here, the authors present MAPS (Machine learning for Analysis of Proteomics in Spatial biology), an approach that facilitates rapid and precise cell type identification with human-level accuracy from spatial proteomics data.

- **DOI:** 10.34123/icdsos.v2023i1.359
- **Abstract:** One of the economic development the focus of the Indonesian government's efforts is for reducing poverty. In Indonesia, collecting poverty data uses the conventional method, the name is National Socio-Economic Survey (SUSENAS) which takes a large cost, time, and effort. To overcome these limitations, there is a need for additional data to provide more detailed poverty data. Recent studies show that the use of geospatial big data could identify poverty at a granular level, with a lower cost and faster update because of their unique and unbiased capacity to identify physical and socioeconomic phenomena. The integrated multi-source satellite imagery data such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for detecting rural areas based on vegetation, built-up index (BUI) for identifying urban areas through building distribution, normalized difference water index (NDWI) for land cover detection, day time land surface temperature (LST) for identifying urban regions based on surface temperature, and pollutants such as carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) to evaluate economic activities based on pollution. Additionally, point of interest (POI) density and minimum POI distance are used to measure area accessibility. Therefore, the contribution of this research is to implement the utilization of geospatial big data to estimate the numbers of poverties at a granular level to the 666 sub-districts in East Java Province using machine learning and deep learning regression models. The evaluation results to estimate sub-district level poverty shows that the best model development using Support Vector Regression (SVR) in machine learning was the best root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) values of 0.365, 0.293, and 0.032 with R-squared of 0.59 and MLP in deep learning algorithm with 0.444, 0.345, and 0.039 values of RMSE, MAE, and MAPE with R2 0.52. In addition, the results of visual identification revealed that high estimates of lower poverty are typically found in urban areas with high accessibility, and these areas are not spatially deprived areas with limited accessibility.

- **Journal:** Political Analysis
- **Authors:** E. Lipman, Scott Moser, Abel Rodriguez
- **Pub Date:** 2023-12-22
- **DOI:** 10.1017/pan.2025.10014
- **Abstract:** 
 Spatial voting models are widely used in political science to analyze legislators’ preferences and voting behavior. Traditional models assume that legislators’ ideal points are static across different types of votes. This article extends the Bayesian spatial voting model to incorporate hierarchical Bayesian methods, allowing for the identification of covariates that explain differences in legislators’ ideal points across voting domains. We apply this model to procedural and final passage votes in the U.S. House of Representatives from the 93rd through 113th Congresses. Our findings indicate that legislators in the minority party and those representing moderate constituencies are more likely to exhibit different ideal points between procedural and final passage votes. This research advances the methodology of ideal point estimation by simultaneously scaling ideal points and explaining variation in these points, providing a more nuanced understanding of legislative voting behavior.

- **DOI:** 10.1038/s41467-023-43458-x
- **Abstract:** Single-cell and spatial technologies that profile gene expression across a whole tissue are revolutionizing the resolution of molecular states in clinical samples. Current commercially available technologies provide whole transcriptome single-cell, whole transcriptome spatial, or targeted in situ gene expression analysis. Here, we combine these technologies to explore tissue heterogeneity in large, FFPE human breast cancer sections. This integrative approach allowed us to explore molecular differences that exist between distinct tumor regions and to identify biomarkers involved in the progression towards invasive carcinoma. Further, we study cell neighborhoods and identify rare boundary cells that sit at the critical myoepithelial border confining the spread of malignant cells. Here, we demonstrate that each technology alone provides information about molecular signatures relevant to understanding cancer heterogeneity; however, it is the integration of these technologies that leads to deeper insights, ushering in discoveries that will progress oncology research and the development of diagnostics and therapeutics.

- **Abstract:** Abstract This study investigates the evolution of public space and its impact on everyday life using a community-based and interpretive approach, as well as qualitative and quantitative methods and socio-spatial comparative analysis. The study focuses on three urban spaces from New York, Moscow, and Berlin, representing the sociopolitical dynamics of capitalism and socialism during the Cold War. The findings highlight the dynamic and ever-changing nature of public spaces, which constantly reproduce themselves even in unexpected circumstances. The study identifies effective socio-spatial breaking points that shape public life and emphasizes public spaces’ novelty, dynamism, and political nature. Furthermore, the study reveals the intricate interplay between global events and their human-scale impact on urban spaces. This study is significant because it takes an interdisciplinary approach that combines sociology and spatial science, employing socio-spatial methods to assess the impact of public life. The study acknowledges its limitations, such as the possibility of unanticipated future effects and the need for additional research that includes a broader range of public spaces. Overall, this article contributes to the growing body of research on the relationship between global events and the novelty of urban life by providing an insightful perspective on the transformation of public life.

- **Journal:** Science of the Total Environment
- **Authors:** Julian Koch, Hyojin Kim, Joel Tirado-Conde, Birgitte G Hansen, Ingelise Møller, L. Thorling, L. Troldborg, D. Voutchkova, A. Højberg
- **Pub Date:** 2024-07-01
- **DOI:** 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.174533
- **Abstract:** Redox conditions play a crucial role in determining the fate of many contaminants in groundwater, impacting ecosystem services vital for both the aquatic environment and human water supply. Geospatial machine learning has previously successfully modelled large-scale redox conditions. This study is the first to consolidate the complementary information provided by sediment color and water chemistry to enhance our understanding of redox conditions in Denmark. In the first step, the depth to the first redox interface is modelled using sediment color from 27,042 boreholes. In the second step, the depth of the first redox interface is compared against water chemistry data at 22,198 wells to classify redox complexity. The absence of nitrate containing water below the first redox interface is referred to as continuous redox conditions. In contrast, discontinuous redox conditions are identified by the presence of nitrate below the first redox interface. Both models are built using 20 covariate maps, encompassing diverse hydrologically relevant information. The first redox interface is modelled with a mean error of 0.0 m and a root-mean-squared error of 8.0 m. The redox complexity model attains an accuracy of 69.8 %. Results indicate a mean depth to the first redox interface of 8.6 m and a standard deviation of 6.5 m. 60 % of Denmark is classified as discontinuous, indicating complex redox conditions, predominantly collocated in clay rich glacial landscapes. Both maps, i.e., first redox interface and redox complexity are largely driven by the water table and hydrogeology. The developed maps contribute to our understanding of subsurface redox processes, supporting national-scale land-use and water management.

- **Pub Date:** 2023-11-08
- **DOI:** 10.3390/urbansci7040116
- **Abstract:** Reliable data on slums or deprived living conditions remain scarce in many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Global high-resolution maps of deprived areas are fundamental for both research- and evidence-based policies. Existing mapping methods are generally one-off studies that use proprietary commercial data or other physical or socio-economic data that are limited geographically. Open geospatial data are increasingly available for large areas; however, their unstructured nature has hindered their use in extracting useful insights to inform decision making. In this study, we demonstrate an approach to map deprived areas within and across cities using open-source geospatial data. The study tests this methodology in three African cities—Accra (Ghana), Lagos (Nigeria), and Nairobi (Kenya) using a three arc second spatial resolution. Using three machine learning classifiers, (i) models were trained and tested on individual cities to assess the scalability for large area application, (ii) city-to-city comparisons were made to assess how the models performed in new locations, and (iii) a generalized model to assess our ability to map across cities with training samples from each city was designed. Our best models achieved over 80% accuracy in all cities. The study demonstrates an inexpensive, scalable, and transferable approach to map deprived areas that outperforms existing large area methods.

### 3. [The urbanisation of controlled environment agriculture: Why does it matter for urban studies?](https://doi.org/10.1177/00420980231200991)
- **Journal:** Urban studies
- **Authors:** Simon Marvin, Lauren Rickards, Jonathan Rutherford
- **Pub Date:** 2023-10-09
- **DOI:** 10.1177/00420980231200991
- **Abstract:** This paper critically examines why urban studies should be interested in the emergence of controlled environment agriculture. Over the last decade, there has been significant commercial and urban policy interest in controlled environment agriculture systems for producing food in enclosed environments. Furthermore, there has been a significant expansion in research publications on urban controlled environment agriculture, stressing the novel character of these systems and the complex relationships with the conventional concerns of urban agriculture. The paper subjects these claims to critical scrutiny and then reconceptualises urban controlled environment agriculture as an emergent urban infrastructure of artificial, highly productive microclimates and ecosystems for non-human life designed to increase the productive use of ‘surplus or under-utilised’ urban spaces. We argue that controlled environment agriculture tries to secure food production through three spatial–temporal fixes: (1) the enclosure move – holding food closer by substituting the increasingly hostile outdoors for the controlled indoors in order to optimise yield, quality, efficiency and the ‘cleanness’ of the food; (2) the urban move – holding food closer to the city by substituting rural agricultural space for urban space to shorten supply chains and thereby help secure food production and improve its green credentials; and (3) combining 1 and 2, the urban interiorisation move – holding food yet closer still by moving food production into city buildings and intricate infrastructural systems, increasing control by securing total environments. In these ways, the paper shows how urban controlled environment agriculture selectively extends existing logics of urban and rural agriculture and identifies the future research challenges for urban studies.

- **Journal:** Crime Science
- **Authors:** R. Boivin, Silas Nogueira de Melo
- **Pub Date:** 2023-09-11
- **DOI:** 10.1186/s40163-023-00193-4
- **Abstract:** Purpose The introduction of community policing led to a significant increase in the number of police stations, particularly in urban settings. Police stations are largely assumed to have an impact on crime but there are few studies dedicated to the issue. Methods The concept of deterrence suggests a negative relationship between police and crime: an increased police presence should lead to a reduction of crime. While it is difficult to directly test that relationship, the present study takes advantage of two recent events in Montreal (Canada) to test the hypothesis that the closure of a police station causes an increase of crime in the surrounding area. Andresen’s Spatial point pattern tests and Wheeler and Ratcliffe’ weight displacement difference tests were conducted. Findings While tests suggest that crime geographic patterns were dissimilar pre- and post-closure, none of those differences support the deterrence hypothesis because the number of areas in which an increase in crime was recorded is lower than would be expected by chance. Similarly, decreases in breaking and entering, mischief, theft in or on vehicles and total crime were found, which does not support the deterrence hypothesis. Conclusions The study of hotspot policing led to the belief that police presence needs to be concentrated in both time and space if it is to have a significant preventive impact on crime. It also led to the development of strategies of concentrated policing that encompass a variety of prevention actions aimed at specific individuals, specific crime types, and/or specific areas. Police stations provide something different: a concentrated presence at one point location with the ability to deploy to respond to any crime, at any time, in a particular area.

- **DOI:** 10.1038/s41467-023-39647-3
- **Abstract:** Detailed and location-aware distribution grid information is a prerequisite for various power system applications such as renewable energy integration, wildfire risk assessment, and infrastructure planning. However, a generalizable and scalable approach to obtain such information is still lacking. In this work, we develop a machine-learning-based framework to map both overhead and underground distribution grids using widely-available multi-modal data including street view images, road networks, and building maps. Benchmarked against the utility-owned distribution grid map in California, our framework achieves > 80% precision and recall on average in the geospatial mapping of grids. The framework developed with the California data can be transferred to Sub-Saharan Africa and maintain the same level of precision without fine-tuning, demonstrating its generalizability. Furthermore, our framework achieves a R2 of 0.63 in measuring the fraction of underground power lines at the aggregate level for estimating grid exposure to wildfires. We offer the framework as an open tool for mapping and analyzing distribution grids solely based on publicly-accessible data to support the construction and maintenance of reliable and clean energy systems around the world.

### 1. [The dawn of spatial omics](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abq4964)
- **Journal:** Science
- **Authors:** D. Bressan, G. Battistoni, G. Hannon
- **Pub Date:** 2023-08-04
- **DOI:** 10.1126/science.abq4964
- **Abstract:** Spatial omics has been widely heralded as the new frontier in life sciences. This term encompasses a wide range of techniques that promise to transform many areas of biology and eventually revolutionize pathology by measuring physical tissue structure and molecular characteristics at the same time. Although the field came of age in the past 5 years, it still suffers from some growing pains: barriers to entry, robustness, unclear best practices for experimental design and analysis, and lack of standardization. In this Review, we present a systematic catalog of the different families of spatial omics technologies; highlight their principles, power, and limitations; and give some perspective and suggestions on the biggest challenges that lay ahead in this incredibly powerful—but still hard to navigate—landscape. Description Editor’s summary All of biology happens in space. In living organisms, cells must interact and assemble in three-dimensional tissues. The position of each cell is just as important as its intrinsic nature in determining how a tissue functions or malfunctions in a disease. Recently, many technologies have been invented to profile cells without removing them from their natural context, measuring gene expression and the regulatory landscape of a cell’s genome alongside its spatial location within a tissue. In a review, Bressan et al. describe the features of these methods, collectively named spatial omics, and discuss what is missing for them to unlock their full potential. —Stella M. Hurtley and Gemma Alderton A review discusses recent advances in methods for spatial omics. BACKGROUND Just as single-cell sequencing has revolutionized many fields of biology, spatial “omics,” in which molecular parameters are measured in situ on intact tissue samples, is set to empower a new generation of scientific discoveries. A plethora of new technologies now enable spatial profiling of gene and protein expression, genetic mutations, epigenetic marks, chromatin structure, and genome organization. Most of these methods trace back to traditional techniques such as immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, or leverage the throughput of next-generation sequencing by converting spatial coordinates to sequence barcodes. Spatial omics technologies operate at vastly different levels of resolution, sensitivity, and throughput. There are also considerable differences in ease of adoption, compatibility with different sample types, commercial availability, upfront investment, and cost per sample. In such a rich and constantly evolving field, choosing the best technology to address a specific biological challenge—carefully weighting the strengths and weaknesses of each—is critical. ADVANCES The field of spatial molecular profiling has come of age over the past few years. Current RNA profiling technologies allow the spatial measurement of gene expression for centimeter-scale samples—in many cases, at single-cell resolution. Targeted methods can quantify thousands of transcripts, including those of very low abundance, whereas untargeted protocols offer transcriptome-wide profiling and can even detect gene isoforms and mutations, with coverage approaching that of disaggregated single-cell methods. Multiplexed immunohistochemistry protocols, either based on mass spectrometry or fluorescence imaging, can similarly be used to profile tens to hundreds of protein markers on a wide range of samples. Recent studies have reported additional approaches that recover other types of molecular information, including the spatial profiling of genomic organization for thousands of loci, open chromatin and epigenetic marks, and untargeted in situ DNA sequencing. Multi-omic technologies capturing multiple sources of information at once are also becoming available. As these methods become more reliable and widely adopted, it is becoming increasingly clear that spatial omics will contribute substantially to the elucidation of many biological questions, with prominent examples in fields ranging from oncology (such as the study of tumor heterogeneity and microenvironment) to neuroscience and organismal development. OUTLOOK Future development trends in the spatial omic area are needed in three main areas: (i) multi-omics, which is defined as the simultaneous measurement of different parameters (for example, DNA, RNA, and protein); (ii) increased access and democratization, with technologies becoming more readily available, more reliable, and more robust; and (iii) improved analysis frameworks. As technologies continue to evolve, it will become necessary to dedicate more attention to data analysis and experimental design. Spatial omics technologies can already generate many terabytes of data in a single experiment, creating substantial challenges in data processing, analysis, and visualization. Statistical methods and guidelines for sample replication, study design, and batch correction are also lagging behind, although they’re evolving rapidly. Last, as the future keeps getting closer, we foresee that spatial omics will likely evolve toward three-dimensional spatial omics (operating on whole organs or even organisms) and spatial-temporal omics (performing measurements multiple times in vivo), adding further powerful and exciting tools to biology’s toolbox. Spatial omics methods profile the molecular make-up of tissues, preserving their spatial organization through four main steps. (A) Detection. Oligonucleotide probes or modified antibodies bind to specific nucleic acids, proteins, or small molecules. Alternatively, enzymatic processes can detect RNA (reverse transcription) or DNA (tagmentation) in an untargeted fashion. Single or multiple types of biomolecules can be profiled simultaneously. (B) Identification. Biomolecules can be identified directly with next-generation sequencing or mass spectrometry, or indirectly by means of an individual tag on the detection probe that is either read at once or sequentially (combinatorial barcode). (C) Measurement. Imaging-based methods measure the signal intensity of fluorescent probes or count the number of spots per area (single-molecule localization methods). Sequencing-based methods quantify the abundance of biomolecules through normalized read count or using unique molecular identifiers (UMIs). (D) Localization. Biomolecules are assigned to their spatial locations either directly in imaging-based methods, or by means of a DNA barcode decoded through sequencing. Technologies differ widely in terms of spatial resolution, sensitivity, and number and size of areas that can be profiled.

- **Journal:** Regional Science Policy &amp; Practice
- **Authors:** Xiaoxuan Zhang, J. Gibson, Xiangzheng Deng
- **Pub Date:** 2023-08-03
- **DOI:** 10.1111/rsp3.12716
- **Abstract:** Regional science and economics studies increasingly use Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) night‐time lights data to measure spatial inequality. These DMSP data are a poor proxy in this context because of their spatially mean‐reverting errors, which yield significantly lower inequality estimates than what sub‐national GDP data show. Inequality estimates from DMSP are also lower than what newer, research‐focused and more accurate, satellites show. We demonstrate this bias using county‐level data from China and the United States. The errors in the DMSP data distort estimates of both the level of, and trend in, spatial inequality.

- **Pub Date:** 2023-06-01
- **DOI:** 10.2139/ssrn.4497991
- **Abstract:** Two factors have elevated recent academic and policy interest in tropical deforestation: first, the realization that it is a major contributor to climate change; and second, a revolution in satellite-based measurement that has revealed that it is proceeding at a rapid rate. We begin by reviewing the methodological advances that have enabled measurement of forest loss at a fine spatial resolution across the globe. We then develop a simple benchmark model of deforestation based on classic models of natural resource extraction. Extending this approach to incorporate features that characterize deforestation in developing countries—pressure for land use change, significant local and global externalities, weak property rights, and political economy constraints—provides us with a framework for reviewing the fast-growing empirical literature on the economics of deforestation in the tropics. This combination of theory and empirics provides insights not only into the economic drivers and impacts of tropical deforestation but also into policies that may affect its progression. We conclude by identifying areas where more work is needed in this important body of research.

- **Abstract:** Spatial proteomics technologies have revealed an underappreciated link between the location of cells in tissue microenvironments and the underlying biology and clinical features, but there is significant lag in the development of downstream analysis methods and benchmarking tools. Here we present SPIAT (spatial image analysis of tissues), a spatial-platform agnostic toolkit with a suite of spatial analysis algorithms, and spaSim (spatial simulator), a simulator of tissue spatial data. SPIAT includes multiple colocalization, neighborhood and spatial heterogeneity metrics to characterize the spatial patterns of cells. Ten spatial metrics of SPIAT are benchmarked using simulated data generated with spaSim. We show how SPIAT can uncover cancer immune subtypes correlated with prognosis in cancer and characterize cell dysfunction in diabetes. Our results suggest SPIAT and spaSim as useful tools for quantifying spatial patterns, identifying and validating correlates of clinical outcomes and supporting method development. Spatial proteomic data serve to provide cell-level location information for the extraction of biological features from tissues, but analyzing such data can be difficult. Here the authors report the development of SPIAT for data analyses and spaSim for simulation and validation of methods to help bridge the gap between the technology and its translation.

- **Journal:** Political Analysis
- **Authors:** Y. Zhukov, Jason S. Byers, Marty Davidson, Ken Kollman
- **Pub Date:** 2023-03-23
- **DOI:** 10.1017/pan.2023.5
- **Abstract:** 
 Theoretical units of interest often do not align with the spatial units at which data are available. This problem is pervasive in political science, particularly in subnational empirical research that requires integrating data across incompatible geographic units (e.g., administrative areas, electoral constituencies, and grid cells). Overcoming this challenge requires researchers not only to align the scale of empirical and theoretical units, but also to understand the consequences of this change of support for measurement error and statistical inference. We show how the accuracy of transformed values and the estimation of regression coefficients depend on the degree of nesting (i.e., whether units fall completely and neatly inside each other) and on the relative scale of source and destination units (i.e., aggregation, disaggregation, and hybrid). We introduce simple, nonparametric measures of relative nesting and scale, as ex ante indicators of spatial transformation complexity and error susceptibility. Using election data and Monte Carlo simulations, we show that these measures are strongly predictive of transformation quality across multiple change-of-support methods. We propose several validation procedures and provide open-source software to make transformation options more accessible, customizable, and intuitive.
