## 1. A Priori Bounds on Legislative Bargaining Agreements
- **Authors:** Tasos Kalandrakis
- **Journal:** American Journal of Political Science
- **Date:** 2021-11-03
- **Abstract:** In a workhorse model of legislative bargaining with spatial preferences, I establish easy to compute inner and outer bounds on all equilibrium acceptable agreements and outcomes. Using these bounds, I recover and extend conditions for uniqueness of equilibrium, and derive novel proposer advocacy conditions for outcomes to be near the core or the uncovered set. The centrifugal effect of these conditions is reversed as proposal rights are concentrated further away from the center. In the discounted case, there is an outer limit to proposal influence, which becomes non-binding as legislators get patient. The location of the status quo has the expected effect, while the effect of changes in the voting rule is ambiguous. While providing a practical avenue to locating legislative decisions, the analysis highlights the broad conclusion that the proper functioning of democratic institutions is highly contingent on other institutional features besides the proper assignment of voting rights. ∗Thanks to Gleason Judd and audiences at the 2018 MPSA conference, the 2018 CRETE conference, the Wallis brownbag seminar at the University of Rochester, the Political Science speaker series at Washington University, Saint-Louis, and the 2019 Great Lakes Conference at Harris School of Public Policy, University of Chicago.

## 2. Institutional Completeness and Crime Rates in Immigrant Neighborhoods
- **Authors:** Charis E. Kubrin, Young-An Kim, John R. Hipp
- **Journal:** Journal of research in crime and delinquency
- **Date:** 2018-09-19
- **Abstract:** Objectives: A growing body of research finds that immigration has a null or negative association with neighborhood crime rates. We build on this important literature by investigating the extent to which one theory, institutional completeness theory, may help explain lower crime rates in immigrant communities across the Southern California region. Specifically, we test whether two key measures of institutional completeness—the presence of immigrant/ethnic voluntary organizations in the community and the presence and diversity of immigrant/ethnic businesses in the community—account for lower crime rates in some immigrant communities. Method: Compiling a tract-level data set utilizing various data sources, we estimate negative binomial regression models predicting violent and property crime levels that include measures of institutional completeness while controlling for a range of neighborhood correlates of crime. We also account for possible endogeneity by estimating instrumental variable models. Results: The results reveal very limited support for institutional completeness theory. Conclusions: Several possible explanations for these findings are discussed.

## 3. Connected in Crime: The Enduring Effect of Neighborhood Networks on the Spatial Patterning of Violence1
- **Authors:** A. Papachristos, S. Bastomski
- **Journal:** American Journal of Sociology
- **Date:** 2018-09-01
- **Abstract:** The unequal spatial distribution of crime is an enduring feature of cities. While research suggests that spatial diffusion processes heighten this concentration, the actual mechanisms of diffusion are not well understood as research rarely measures the ways in which people, groups, and behaviors connect neighborhoods. This study considers how a particular behavior, criminal co-offending, creates direct and indirect pathways between neighborhoods. Analyzing administrative records and survey data, the authors find that individual acts of co-offending link together to create a “network of neighborhoods,” facilitating the diffusion of crime over time and across space and, in so doing, create pathways between all Chicago neighborhoods. Statistical analyses demonstrate that these neighborhood networks are (1) stable over time; (2) generated by important structural characteristics, social processes, and endogenous network properties; and (3) a better predictor of the geographic distribution of crime than traditional spatial models.

## 5. Urban China through the lens of neoliberalism: Is a conceptual twist enough?
- **Authors:** Yu Zhou, G. Lin, Jun Zhang
- **Journal:** Urban studies
- **Date:** 2018-06-26
- **Abstract:** Neoliberalism as a hegemonic global ideology and framework of governance has been the subject of extensive critical analyses in geography and urban studies. Despite the conceptual difficulties involved, a growing number of scholars have attempted to apply this critical discourse to China. In this commentary, we critically interrogate the urban China literature that deploys the neoliberal lens, mostly authored by scholars outside China, and we raise the fundamental question as to whether this discourse can ever capture the central stories or trajectories of China’s urban transformation. We examine the interpretations of China’s urban land property market, urban inequality and its spatial manifestation, and the emerging urban governmentality – the areas in which neoliberalism has been most often invoked – to highlight the utility and limitations of a neoliberal treatment of China. We argue that the neoliberal representation of China’s urban (re)development, with its preoccupation with capital and class interests, is unable to effectively capture the distinctive nature of entanglement of capital, state and society in China, and thus obscures the driving role and the competing rationalities of the authoritarian state, and the rapid reconfiguration of urban society. By citing examples of recent urban China research, we show that the neoliberalism framework, even in its ‘variegated’ or ‘assemblage’ versions, tends to trap China’s analysis within a frame of reference comfortable to Western researchers, and ultimately hinders the development of diversified, potentially more fruitful inquiries of the urban world.

## 7. Using Social Media to Measure Temporal Ambient Population: Does it Help Explain Local Crime Rates?
- **Authors:** John R. Hipp, Christopher J. Bates, Moshe Lichman, Padhraic Smyth
- **Journal:** Justice quarterly
- **Date:** 2018-03-20
- **Abstract:** A challenge for studies assessing routine activities theory is accounting for the spatial and temporal confluence of offenders and targets given that people move about during the daytime and nighttime. We propose exploiting social media (Twitter) data to construct estimates of the population at various locations at different times of day, and assess whether these estimates help predict the amount of crime during two-hour time periods over the course of the day. We address these questions using crime data for 97,428 blocks in the Southern California region, along with geocoded information on tweets in the region over an eight month period. The results show that this measure of the temporal ambient population helps explain the level of crime in blocks during particular time periods. The use of social media data appear promising for testing various implications of routine activities and crime pattern theories, given their explicit spatial and temporal nature.

## 13. Does the Configuration of the Street Network Influence Where Outdoor Serious Violence Takes Place? Using Space Syntax to Test Crime Pattern Theory
- **Authors:** L. Summers, Shane D. Johnson
- **Journal:** Journal of quantitative criminology
- **Date:** 2016-06-17
- **Abstract:** To examine the effect of the physical layout of the street network on the spatial distribution of outdoor serious violence. Crime pattern theory predicts crime would be more prevalent on more connected, accessible or traveled street segments, as these will be more likely to fall within an offender’s awareness space. The distribution of incidents of outdoor murder, attempted murder and other near-lethal violent crimes that occurred in one London (UK) borough (N = 447 offenses) was analyzed. The space syntax methodology was used to estimate the to- and through-movement potential of individual street segments. Regression analyses showed higher levels of integration (a measure of to-movement potential) and choice (through-movement potential) were associated with greater odds of a street segment containing at least one crime. Risk was also higher for segments located near to segments with the highest global choice values. In contrast, connectivity (the number of other segments a street segment is adjacent to) was negatively associated with crime occurrence. As predicted, the configuration of the street network was associated with the spatial distribution of outdoor serious violence. Crime reduction measures should be targeted at high-choice street segments (typically main arteries) and segments nearby.

## 17. Examining the Relationship Between Road Structure and Burglary Risk Via Quantitative Network Analysis
- **Authors:** Toby P Davies, Shane D. Johnson
- **Journal:** Journal of quantitative criminology
- **Date:** 2014-10-11
- **Abstract:** To test the hypothesis that the spatial distribution of residential burglary is shaped by the configuration of the street network, as predicted by, for example, crime pattern theory. In particular, the study examines whether burglary risk is higher on street segments with higher usage potential. Residential burglary data for Birmingham (UK) are examined at the street segment level using a hierarchical linear model. Estimates of the usage of street segments are derived from the graph theoretical metric of betweenness, which measures how frequently segments feature in the shortest paths (those most likely to be used) through the network. Several variants of betweenness are considered. The geometry of street segments is also incorporated—via a measure of their linearity—as are several socio-demographic factors. As anticipated by theory, the measure of betweenness was found to be a highly-significant predictor of the burglary victimization count at the street segment level for all but one of the variants considered. The non-significant result was found for the most localized measure of betweenness considered. More linear streets were generally found to be at lower risk of victimization. Betweenness offers a more granular and objective means of measuring the street network than categorical classifications previously used, and its meaning links more directly to theory. The results provide support for crime pattern theory, suggesting a higher risk of burglary for streets with more potential usage. The apparent negative effect of linearity suggests the need for further research into the visual component of target choice, and the role of guardianship.

## 18. Determinants of urban sprawl in European cities
- **Authors:** W. Oueslati, S. Alvanides, G. Garrod
- **Journal:** Urban studies
- **Date:** 2013-07-15
- **Abstract:** This paper provides empirical evidence that helps to answer several key questions relating to the extent of urban sprawl in Europe. Building on the monocentric city model, this study uses existing data sources to derive a set of panel data for 282 European cities at three time points (1990, 2000 and 2006). Two indices of urban sprawl are calculated that, respectively, reflect changes in artificial area and the levels of urban fragmentation for each city. These are supplemented by a set of data on various economic and geographical variables that might explain the variation of the two indices. Using a Hausman-Taylor estimator and random regressors to control for the possible correlation between explanatory variables and unobservable city-level effects, we find that the fundamental conclusions of the standard monocentric model are valid in the European context for both indices. Although the variables generated by the monocentric model explain a large part of the variation of artificial area, their explanatory power for modelling the fragmentation index is relatively low.
