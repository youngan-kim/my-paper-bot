## 1. A Machine Learning Approach to Analyzing Crime Concentration: The Case of New York City
- **Authors:** Keungoui Kim, Young-An Kim
- **Journal:** Justice quarterly
- **Publication Date:** 2024-10-04
- **DOI:** 10.1080/07418825.2024.2401938
- **Abstract:** Abstract Building upon prior work, we propose an alternative way to look at the pattern of spatial crime concentration and temporal stability of it. We first identify a high-crime cluster using the sample block groups in New York City by employing a k-means clustering method. We then examine the temporal stability of the high-crime cluster over time. We also longitudinally assess how our high-crime cluster classification is associated with the actual amount of crime while accounting for the measures of social and physical environments. We observed that about 6–12% of total areas are identified to be in the high-crime cluster. We also found that block groups identified to be high-crime cluster in one year are more likely to be that way in the next year. We hope future research may consider using data-driven approaches to expand understanding of spatial and temporal crime patterns.

## 3. The urbanisation of controlled environment agriculture: Why does it matter for urban studies?
- **Authors:** Simon Marvin, Lauren Rickards, Jonathan Rutherford
- **Journal:** Urban studies
- **Publication Date:** 2023-10-09
- **DOI:** 10.1177/00420980231200991
- **Abstract:** This paper critically examines why urban studies should be interested in the emergence of controlled environment agriculture. Over the last decade, there has been significant commercial and urban policy interest in controlled environment agriculture systems for producing food in enclosed environments. Furthermore, there has been a significant expansion in research publications on urban controlled environment agriculture, stressing the novel character of these systems and the complex relationships with the conventional concerns of urban agriculture. The paper subjects these claims to critical scrutiny and then reconceptualises urban controlled environment agriculture as an emergent urban infrastructure of artificial, highly productive microclimates and ecosystems for non-human life designed to increase the productive use of ‘surplus or under-utilised’ urban spaces. We argue that controlled environment agriculture tries to secure food production through three spatial–temporal fixes: (1) the enclosure move – holding food closer by substituting the increasingly hostile outdoors for the controlled indoors in order to optimise yield, quality, efficiency and the ‘cleanness’ of the food; (2) the urban move – holding food closer to the city by substituting rural agricultural space for urban space to shorten supply chains and thereby help secure food production and improve its green credentials; and (3) combining 1 and 2, the urban interiorisation move – holding food yet closer still by moving food production into city buildings and intricate infrastructural systems, increasing control by securing total environments. In these ways, the paper shows how urban controlled environment agriculture selectively extends existing logics of urban and rural agriculture and identifies the future research challenges for urban studies.

## 4. Vulnerability in the Neighborhood: A Study of Perceived Control Over Victimization
- **Authors:** C. Keel, Rebecca Wickes, Murray Lee, Jonathan Jackson, K. Benier
- **Journal:** Journal of research in crime and delinquency
- **Publication Date:** 2023-02-20
- **DOI:** 10.1177/00224278221150280
- **Abstract:** Objectives: We test which neighborhood characteristics are associated with perceived control over victimization and how the neighborhood context explains differences between women's and men's perceived control. Methods: Drawing upon administrative data and a survey of 2,862 participants living in 80 neighborhoods in Victoria, Australia, we make a distinction between broader characteristics of the neighborhood, community processes, and gendered neighborhood dynamics. We run a series of multilevel mixed effects regression models to examine the relationship between individual-level perceptions of control over victimization and the neighborhood. Results: Results indicate that a concentration of low-income households in the neighborhood is associated with residents reporting less control over their victimization. Furthermore, the interaction revealed higher crime in the neighborhood lowered women's perceived control while heightening men's perceived control over victimization. Conclusions: Gender remained strongly associated with perceived control over victimization throughout the analysis despite extensive testing of general and gendered neighborhood conditions that may account for differences between women and men. The results found that overall crime rates were the only feature that assisted in explaining the differences between women and men. Future research must seek to better capture the environmental conditions that can account for the difference between women's and men's perceptions.

## 5. Centring the periphery in urban studies: Notes towards a research agenda on peripheral centralities
- **Authors:** N. Phelps, P. Maginn, R. Keil
- **Journal:** Urban studies
- **Publication Date:** 2022-12-14
- **DOI:** 10.1177/00420980221135418
- **Abstract:** Based on presentations across two days as part of an Urban Studies Foundation-funded seminar series, we elaborate a thematic agenda for considering the centrality of urban peripheries. We move beyond a typology of suburban centres to depict senses of peripheral centrality in terms of: their pervasiveness; their visibility across multiple scales; their underlying social relations; the agency exerted in their imagining and production, and the associated policy mobility.

## 6. The spatial (in)stability of mental health calls for police service
- **Authors:** Jacek Koziarski
- **Journal:** Criminology &amp; Public Policy
- **Publication Date:** 2022-12-09
- **DOI:** 10.1111/1745-9133.12612
- **Abstract:** Research summary Policy implications Inspired by studies on crime concentration, scholars have begun examining the spatial patterns of other issues under the police mandate, such as calls for service involving persons with perceived mental illness (PwPMI). While findings show that PwPMI calls for service concentrate in a few number of places, we do not know whether the concentration of these calls fall within a narrow bandwidth of spatial units nor whether these calls are spatially stable. Drawing on 7 years of calls for service data from the Barrie Police Service, this study tests for the temporal stability of PwPMI call for service concentrations at two units of spatial analysis and applies a longitudinal variation of the Spatial Point Pattern Test to assess the spatial stability of these calls at both the global and local levels. The results reveal that concentrations of PwPMI calls for service not only fall within a narrow proportional bandwidth of spatial units, but are spatially stable, even during the COVID‐19 pandemic.Existing police‐ and community‐based efforts that respond to PwPMI in the community are tasked with responding to crises that could have been prevented with timelier intervention. Drawing from crime‐focused, place‐based policing strategies whose deployment is informed by the spatial concentration of crime, scholars have similarly argued that knowledge on where PwPMI calls for service concentrate can be leveraged to inform and deploy place‐based efforts whose focus is to assist PwPMI in a proactive capacity. The findings of the present study further substantiates the deployment of PwPMI‐focused police‐ and community‐based resources as proactive, place‐based efforts. In doing so, these efforts could not only prevent mental health crises from occurring but could prevent future police‐involved calls for service and thus reduce the footprint of the police in the lives of PwPMI in a reactive capacity.

## 7. The spatial dynamics of commercial burglary during the COVID-19 lockdown in San Francisco
- **Authors:** Ha-neul Yim, Jordan R. Riddell
- **Journal:** Journal of Experimental Criminology
- **Publication Date:** 2022-08-18
- **DOI:** 10.1007/s11292-022-09530-0
- **Abstract:** Purpose This paper investigated the impact of COVID-19 stay-at-home regulations on the spatial distribution of commercial burglary in San Francisco. Method Geocoded commercial burglary data for 2003–2021 from San Francisco were analyzed using the Andresen Spatial Point Pattern Test to examine potential spatial movement in commercial burglary. Results Concentrations of commercial burglary spatially shifted following the emergence of COVID-19 and the subsequent stay-at-home orders. Original hot spots experienced a relative decrease in commercial burglary, and crime spread out throughout the city. These spatial changes in commercial burglary appear to be related to variations in guardianship and criminal opportunity. Conclusion These findings suggest that the dramatic shifts in routine activities resulting from the COVID-19 policies could disrupt spatial burglary patterns, especially burglary clustering. Law enforcement should consider the spatial dynamics of commercial burglary, as well as land use heterogeneity, to effectively respond to crime during periods of social distancing and business shutdowns.

## 8. Down with the sickness? Los Angeles burglary and COVID-19 restrictions
- **Authors:** Joshua Hill, George Raber, Laura M. Gulledge
- **Journal:** Journal of Experimental Criminology
- **Publication Date:** 2022-07-11
- **DOI:** 10.1007/s11292-022-09522-0
- **Abstract:** Objectives To provide a partial test of routine activities theory through a spatio-temporal analysis of the impacts of COVID-19 restrictions on burglary in Los Angeles. Methods Spatial point pattern tests, clustering, and non-parametric permutations tests were used to identify changes in burglary in the highest restriction period of 2020 as well as comparison periods for the past 10 years while controlling for the zoning within Los Angeles. Results COVID-19 restrictions significantly increased crime in commercial/industrial areas while it reduced crime in residential areas. Conclusions The predictions of routine activities theory were supported in regard to the importance of capable guardianship. Findings indicate that not only were the areas expected to see an increase in capable guardianship shown to have reduced crime, but that crime more generally across the city became more commercially oriented in terms of zoning as more individuals were confined to residential areas.

## 9. Paws on the Street: Neighborhood-Level Concentration of Households with Dogs and Urban Crime
- **Authors:** Nicolo P. Pinchak, Christopher R. Browning, Bethany Boettner, Catherine A. Calder, Jake Tarrence
- **Journal:** Social forces; a scientific medium of social study and interpretation
- **Publication Date:** 2022-06-25
- **DOI:** 10.1093/sf/soac059
- **Abstract:** Abstract:The formative work of Jane Jacobs underscores the combination of "eyes on the street" and trust between residents in deterring crime. Nevertheless, little research has assessed the effects of residential street monitoring on crime due partly to a lack of data measuring this process. We argue that neighborhood-level rates of households with dogs captures part of the residential street monitoring process core to Jacobs' hypotheses and test whether this measure is inversely associated with property and violent crime rates. Data from a large-scale marketing survey of Columbus, OH, USA residents (2013; n = 43,078) are used to measure census block group-level (n = 595) rates of households with dogs. Data from the Adolescent Health and Development in Context study are used to measure neighborhood-level rates of trust. Consistent with Jacobs' hypotheses, results indicate that neighborhood concentration of households with dogs is inversely associated with robbery, homicide, and, to a less consistent degree, aggravated assault rates within neighborhoods high in trust. In contrast, results for property crime suggest that the inverse association of dog concentration is independent of levels of neighborhood trust. These associations are observed net of controls for neighborhood sociodemographic characteristics, temporally lagged crime, and spatial lags of trust and dog concentration. This study offers suggestive evidence of crime deterrent benefits of local street monitoring and dog presence and calls attention to the contribution of pets to other facets of neighborhood social organization.

## 10. From Residential Neighborhood to Activity Space: The Effects of Educational Segregation on Crime and Their Moderation by Social Context
- **Authors:** Yanji Zhang, Liang Cai, Guangwen Song, Lin Liu, Chunwu Zhu
- **Journal:** Annals of the American Association of Geographers
- **Publication Date:** 2022-06-16
- **DOI:** 10.1080/24694452.2022.2060793
- **Abstract:** The segregation–crime relationship is a classic topic in sociology and crime geography, yet existing literature mainly focuses on the impact of racial segregation at the global scale. Little is known about the impact of local segregation of other socioeconomic characteristics such as education level, an important segregation factor for racially homogenous countries like China. Also unknown is their impact beyond the residential domain. Using the Baidu Map Location-Based Service population data set and court records in 863 local geographic units of the central urban area of Beijing during 2018 and 2019, this study uncovers the spatial pattern of segregation between people with and without a bachelor’s degree measured in the residential space and activity space and further investigates the influence of these two types of educational segregation and their interaction effects with social context on theft and violent crime. Results show less segregation in the activity space than in the residential space. Both types of segregation, however, significantly increase the risk of theft and violence, with activity space–based segregation more consequential. Moreover, the positive segregation–crime link is moderated by the local social context measured by the educational composition among residents and the ambient population. Compared with residential segregation, activity space–based segregation is more detrimental for places dominated by the less educated. Our results highlight the elevated influence of segregation on safety beyond the residential space, especially for areas clustered with the less educated ambient population.

## 11. A more global urban studies, besides empirical variation
- **Authors:** Julie Ren
- **Journal:** Urban studies
- **Publication Date:** 2022-04-01
- **DOI:** 10.1177/00420980221085113
- **Abstract:** An expanded set of sites, a more differentiated set of references and linguistic diversification have been discussed as needed changes in urban studies. The critiques of the limitations of urban studies, in terms of both the scholarship and the scholars, offer important and concrete responses to expanding the scope of the field. Yet this tremendous special issue on ‘Comparative Methods for Global Urban Studies’ with 10 papers cutting across a range of sites and topics is decidedly not only about empirical variation; this is an important distinction worth drawing more attention to. The creativity expressed in these papers comes at an auspicious time in urban studies where new routes for doing urban theory are needed to move past debates about singular versus plural epistemologies of the urban. As a kind of research that demands more translation, exchange and collaboration, perhaps comparative urban research as a mode of theory-building can help to humble the chest-pounding, posturing, privilege of thinking and speaking the language of theory. The theoretical ambitions of these very different papers show how urban theory need not only be about better understanding urbanisation within the epistemological confines of late capitalism. Rather than reifying a shared grammar of urbanisation as a necessity to understand each other, they may entice scholars everywhere to develop a broader vocabulary and perhaps even learn another language.

## 12. Who Leaves and Who Enters? Flow Measures of Neighborhood Change and Consequences for Neighborhood Crime
- **Authors:** John R. Hipp, Alyssa W. Chamberlain
- **Journal:** Journal of research in crime and delinquency
- **Publication Date:** 2022-03-24
- **DOI:** 10.1177/00224278221088534
- **Abstract:** Objectives Longitudinal studies of the relationship between neighborhood change and changes in crime typically focus exclusively on the net level of change in key socio-demographic characteristics. Methods We instead propose a demographic accounting strategy that captures the composition of neighborhood change: our measures capture which types of people are more likely to leave, stay, or enter the neighborhood. We use data for 3,325 tracts in the Southern California region over nearly two decades of 2000–2010 and 2010–2017 and construct flow measures based on race/ethnicity; the length of residence of owners and renters; the age structure. Results These flow measures improve the predictive power of the models—implying important theoretical insights. Neighborhoods with higher percentages of middle-aged residents who recently entered the neighborhood exhibit larger increases in violent and property crime. The relative stability of those in the highest crime-prone ages (aged 15–29) is associated with the largest increases in violent and property crime. The greater loss of Black and Asian residents decreased crime while moderate outflows of Latinos increased crime. The mobility of long- and short-term renters was related to crime changes. Conclusions This new technique will likely encourage further theoretical innovation for the neighborhoods and crime literature.

## 13. Is urbanisation in the Global South fundamentally different? Comparative global urban analysis for the 21st century
- **Authors:** Gregory F. Randolph, M. Storper
- **Journal:** Urban studies
- **Publication Date:** 2022-02-08
- **DOI:** 10.1177/00420980211067926
- **Abstract:** A vigorous debate has emerged in recent years over how to understand cities of the Global South. A pivotal issue in this debate is whether urbanisation processes in the South are so fundamentally different from historical and current urbanisation in the Global North that many of the theories developed from studying the latter have limited utility in application to the former. In this article, we review evidence from a range of disciplines on recent and ongoing urban transitions and urbanisation dynamics in the Global South, attending to features that distinguish the urban South from the urban North. Our reading of the evidence indicates that parts of the Global South may be urbanising along historically and geographically specific trajectories; however, we argue that these differences are best understood through a unified set of global urban theories. Rather than flattening or silencing difference, theories that seek generalisation across time and space sharpen the identification and appreciation of key differences in urbanisation processes. Analysing how the fundamental dynamics of urbanisation recombine and interact with one another in different contexts offers insight into policy challenges that cut across cities, both within and between the Global South and North, as well as context-specific policy issues that arise through the interaction of global urbanisation forces and local specificities.

## 14. How Does Crime-Specific Victimization Impact Fear of Crime in Urban China? The Role of Neighborhood Characteristics
- **Authors:** Fengrui Jing, Lin Liu, Suhong Zhou, Jiaxin Feng
- **Journal:** International journal of offender therapy and comparative criminology
- **Publication Date:** 2021-12-21
- **DOI:** 10.1177/0306624X211066829
- **Abstract:** Past research has failed to find consistent relationships between criminal victimization and fear of crime. Except for neighborhood disorder and crime rate, few studies have examined whether other neighborhood conditions matter the victimization—fear relationship. Using survey data in Guangzhou neighborhoods, the present analysis employs multinomial logistic regression models to examine whether neighborhood characteristics moderate the relationship between violent victimization and fear of violence, and between burglary victimization and fear of burglary, separately. Some aspects of the neighborhood environment do differentially influence victims’ and non-victims’ fear levels. Besides verifying the interaction effect of neighborhood disorder and victimization, the present study finds that neighborhood policing alleviates the harmful effect of violent victimization on fear, while collective efficacy fosters the harmful effect of burglary victimization on fear. This paper underscores the significance of the social context of urban China in explaining the interplay of neighborhood characteristics and victimization on fear of crime.

## 15. Urban studies in India across the millennial turn: Histories and futures
- **Authors:** K. Coelho, A. Sood
- **Journal:** Urban studies
- **Publication Date:** 2021-12-17
- **DOI:** 10.1177/00420980211056773
- **Abstract:** The millennial turn saw a distinct efflorescence in scholarship on urban India. This essay introduces a Virtual Special Issue on urban studies in India that showcases a selection of articles from the journal’s archives. It traces the disciplinary, thematic and methodological shifts that have marked this millennial turn. On the one hand, the social science of the urban has had a statist bent, reacting to the policy focus on cities as growth engines in the post-liberalisation era. On the other hand, critical urban studies has brought attention to the unregulated, deregulated, unplanned and unintended city produced by dynamic processes of informality acting overtly or covertly against the state’s neoliberal agendas. This introductory essay aims to examine the ways this interplay has unfolded both in the pages of this journal and elsewhere. It locates the Virtual Special Issue selection within a broader review of the state of scholarship in Indian urban studies and marks out areas for productive interventions in the future study of Indian cities.

## 17. Economic Inequality Decomposition and Spatial Pattern of Crime in Indonesia
- **Authors:** Putu Angga Widyastaman, D. Hartono
- **Journal:** Papers in applied geography
- **Publication Date:** 2021-10-14
- **DOI:** 10.1080/23754931.2021.1991842
- **Abstract:** Abstract Rising crime victimization rate in Indonesia shows that crime is still a serious problem in the country. This study aims to identify the relationship between economic inequality and crime rate in Indonesia. It used the decomposed Theil indices, as the measure of inequality based on national household survey panel data, to disentangle the effect of economic inequality into within-district/city and between-district/city economic inequality components. This choice of inequality measure is due to the fact that most of the previous studies regarding economic inequality and crime overlooked the disentanglement between economic inequality effects. Another problem addressed by this study is that the effect of crime is not bounded by administrative boundaries. A high prevalence of crime in a region may cause a criminal spillover to the surrounding regions. To control for this effect, this study also evaluates the spatial effect of interregional crime rates using the panel spatial autoregressive model as the estimation method. The estimation results revealed that both within-region and across-region economic inequalities have substantial increasing impacts on the crime rate.

## 18. Gendered fear of crime in the urban context: A comparative multilevel study of women’s and men’s fear of crime
- **Authors:** Sofia Johansson, Karen Haandrikman
- **Journal:** Journal of Urban Affairs
- **Publication Date:** 2021-06-25
- **DOI:** 10.1080/07352166.2021.1923372
- **Abstract:** ABSTRACT Women generally feel more fearful than men. We study this so-called fear-gender gap, by contributing to a growing body of quantitative gender-sensitive research inspired by feminist theory. We depart from traditional quantitative fear of crime research that fails to examine how determinants of fear of crime impact women and men differently. We use a Dutch governmental survey, linked to neighborhood characteristics, to conduct multilevel modeling using multifaceted sociospatial aspects on individual and neighborhood level, to explain the fear-gender gap in the city of Eindhoven. Findings indicate that the sociospatial environment and the perceptions thereof offer insights into gendered differences in fear. A central finding is that fear of crime among women is particularly complex. We discuss the concept of fear of crime, the importance of feminist theory to inform data gathering in order to further future quantitative research on fear of crime, and make suggestions for future research.

## 19. Geographic disparities in violent crime during the COVID-19 lockdown in Miami-Dade County, Florida, 2018–2020
- **Authors:** Imelda K. Moise, A. Piquero
- **Journal:** Journal of Experimental Criminology
- **Publication Date:** 2021-06-17
- **DOI:** 10.1007/s11292-021-09474-x
- **Abstract:** Abstract Objectives This study uses two cluster detection techniques to identify clusters of violent crime during the 3 months of the 2020 COVID-19 lockdown in Miami-Dade County compared to that during an equivalent period in 2018 and 2019. Methods Violent crime data from the Miami-Dade Central Records Bureau were analyzed. The Local Indicators of Spatial Association statistics and a space‐time permutation statistic were used to identify clusters of violent crimes and outliers, and Global Moran’s I tool was used to assess spatial patterning in violent crime. Neighborhood disadvantage data were obtained from the American Community Survey 5-year estimates linked with arrest locations. Results Violent crime arrests fell by 7.1% in 2020. Arrests were concentrated in predominantly Black disadvantaged neighborhoods in the northern part, and similar results were produced for core clusters by the two cluster techniques with positive global Moran’s I for all study years. Although accounting for only 17% of the county population, nearly half of violent crime arrests were for Black or African American. Males comprised most violent crime arrests. Conclusions Crime prevention and intervention efforts should be focused on both high-risk places and offenders.

## 20. Critical Commentary: Repopulating density: COVID-19 and the politics of urban value
- **Authors:** Colin Mcfarlane
- **Journal:** Urban studies
- **Publication Date:** 2021-06-09
- **DOI:** 10.1177/00420980211014810
- **Abstract:** How might concepts of ‘value’ and ‘population’ illuminate the present and future of urban density? The COVID-19 pandemic prompted a public debate on density in the city. While some initially blamed density for the spread of the virus, others rightly cautioned against those claims. As the pandemic progressed, an imaginary of density-as-pathology gave way to a more nuanced geographical understanding of the urban dimensions of the crisis, focused on connections, spatial conditions, domestic ‘overcrowding’ and poverty. Throughout, an interrogation and reflection on urban density and its future unfolded, throwing into question the historical relationship between ‘value’ and ‘population’ in understandings of density. I argue for a new politics of value based on shifts in three interconnected domains – governance, form and knowledge – and identify implications for research on density in urban studies.
