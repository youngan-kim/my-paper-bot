### Paws on the Street: Neighborhood-Level Concentration of Households with Dogs and Urban Crime
- **Journal:** Social forces; a scientific medium of social study and interpretation
- **Year:** 2022
- **DOI:** 10.1093/sf/soac059
- **Abstract:** Abstract:The formative work of Jane Jacobs underscores the combination of "eyes on the street" and trust between residents in deterring crime. Nevertheless, little research has assessed the effects of residential street monitoring on crime due partly to a lack of data measuring this process. We argue that neighborhood-level rates of households with dogs captures part of the residential street monitoring process core to Jacobs' hypotheses and test whether this measure is inversely associated with property and violent crime rates. Data from a large-scale marketing survey of Columbus, OH, USA residents (2013; n = 43,078) are used to measure census block group-level (n = 595) rates of households with dogs. Data from the Adolescent Health and Development in Context study are used to measure neighborhood-level rates of trust. Consistent with Jacobs' hypotheses, results indicate that neighborhood concentration of households with dogs is inversely associated with robbery, homicide, and, to a less consistent degree, aggravated assault rates within neighborhoods high in trust. In contrast, results for property crime suggest that the inverse association of dog concentration is independent of levels of neighborhood trust. These associations are observed net of controls for neighborhood sociodemographic characteristics, temporally lagged crime, and spatial lags of trust and dog concentration. This study offers suggestive evidence of crime deterrent benefits of local street monitoring and dog presence and calls attention to the contribution of pets to other facets of neighborhood social organization.

### Who Leaves and Who Enters? Flow Measures of Neighborhood Change and Consequences for Neighborhood Crime
- **Journal:** Journal of research in crime and delinquency
- **Year:** 2022
- **DOI:** 10.1177/00224278221088534
- **Abstract:** Objectives Longitudinal studies of the relationship between neighborhood change and changes in crime typically focus exclusively on the net level of change in key socio-demographic characteristics. Methods We instead propose a demographic accounting strategy that captures the composition of neighborhood change: our measures capture which types of people are more likely to leave, stay, or enter the neighborhood. We use data for 3,325 tracts in the Southern California region over nearly two decades of 2000–2010 and 2010–2017 and construct flow measures based on race/ethnicity; the length of residence of owners and renters; the age structure. Results These flow measures improve the predictive power of the models—implying important theoretical insights. Neighborhoods with higher percentages of middle-aged residents who recently entered the neighborhood exhibit larger increases in violent and property crime. The relative stability of those in the highest crime-prone ages (aged 15–29) is associated with the largest increases in violent and property crime. The greater loss of Black and Asian residents decreased crime while moderate outflows of Latinos increased crime. The mobility of long- and short-term renters was related to crime changes. Conclusions This new technique will likely encourage further theoretical innovation for the neighborhoods and crime literature.

### How Does Crime-Specific Victimization Impact Fear of Crime in Urban China? The Role of Neighborhood Characteristics
- **Journal:** International journal of offender therapy and comparative criminology
- **Year:** 2021
- **DOI:** 10.1177/0306624X211066829
- **Abstract:** Past research has failed to find consistent relationships between criminal victimization and fear of crime. Except for neighborhood disorder and crime rate, few studies have examined whether other neighborhood conditions matter the victimization—fear relationship. Using survey data in Guangzhou neighborhoods, the present analysis employs multinomial logistic regression models to examine whether neighborhood characteristics moderate the relationship between violent victimization and fear of violence, and between burglary victimization and fear of burglary, separately. Some aspects of the neighborhood environment do differentially influence victims’ and non-victims’ fear levels. Besides verifying the interaction effect of neighborhood disorder and victimization, the present study finds that neighborhood policing alleviates the harmful effect of violent victimization on fear, while collective efficacy fosters the harmful effect of burglary victimization on fear. This paper underscores the significance of the social context of urban China in explaining the interplay of neighborhood characteristics and victimization on fear of crime.

### Marijuana Dispensaries and Neighborhood Crime and Disorder in Denver, Colorado
- **Journal:** Justice quarterly
- **Year:** 2020
- **DOI:** 10.1080/07418825.2019.1567807
- **Abstract:** Abstract Beginning with Colorado and Washington State in 2012, longstanding bans on the sale, possession, and use of marijuana for recreational purposes have been overturned in nine states and the nation’s capital. Consistent with the logic of routine activity theory and broken windows theory, critics of legalized marijuana argue that dispensaries are magnets for crime, attracting criminal offenders to the area with large sums of cash and valuable goods. The current study addresses this possibility by examining the effects of both medical and recreational marijuana dispensaries on yearly crime rates in N = 3981 neighborhood grid cells in Denver, Colorado, 2012–2015. Estimates from Bayesian spatiotemporal Poisson regression models indicate that, except for murder and auto theft, both types of dispensaries are associated with statistically significant increases in rates of neighborhood crime and disorder. The theoretical and policy implications of these findings are discussed.

### Looking Through Broken Windows: The Impact of Neighborhood Disorder on Aggression and Fear of Crime Is an Artifact of Research Design
- **Journal:** annual review of criminology
- **Year:** 2019
- **DOI:** 10.1146/ANNUREV-CRIMINOL-011518-024638
- **Abstract:** Broken windows theory (BWT) has heavily influenced social science and policy over the past 30 years. It posits that disorder in neighborhoods leads to elevated crime by inviting additional criminal activity and by discouraging the positive social behavior that prevents crime. Scholars have debated the veracity of BWT, and here we conduct a meta-analysis of 96 studies to examine the effects of disorder on residents’ ( a) general proclivities for aggressive behavior and ( b) perceptions of and attitudes toward their neighborhood (e.g., fear of crime), with particular attention to aspects of research design that might confound causal inference. We found no consistent evidence that disorder induces greater aggression or more negative attitudes toward the neighborhood. Studies that found such effects disproportionately utilized weaker research designs that omit key correlates or confound perceptions of disorder with other neighborhood attitudes. We explore implications for theory, research, and policy.

### Network Spillovers and Neighborhood Crime: A Computational Statistics Analysis of Employment-Based Networks of Neighborhoods
- **Journal:** Justice quarterly
- **Year:** 2019
- **DOI:** 10.1080/07418825.2019.1602160
- **Abstract:** Abstract Research on communities and crime has predominantly focused on social conditions within an area or in its immediate proximity. However, a growing body of research shows that people often travel to areas away from home, contributing to connections between places. A few studies highlight the criminological implications of such connections, focusing on important but rare ties like co-offending or gang conflicts. The current study extends this idea by analyzing more common ties based on commuting across Chicago communities. It integrates standard criminological methods with machine learning and computational statistics approaches to investigate the extent to which neighborhood crime depends on the disadvantage of areas connected to it through commuting. The findings suggest that connected communities can influence each other from a distance and that connectivity to less disadvantaged work hubs may decrease local crime – with implications for advancing knowledge on the relational ecology of crime, social isolation, and ecological networks.

### Modeling Crime in an Uptown Neighborhood: The Case of Santa Fe in Mexico City
- **Journal:** Papers in applied geography
- **Year:** 2019
- **DOI:** 10.1080/23754931.2018.1554502
- **Abstract:** Abstract What are the correlates of crime incidence in an uptown and wealthy neighborhood? This article focuses on the Santa Fe neighborhood in Mexico City as a case study to answer to this question. Theoretically, it makes use of crime pattern and social disorganization theories. It is argued that crime incidence in an uptown neighborhood can also be modeled based on variables that represent crime generators and crime attractors. It is also argued that the existence of structurally disadvantaged census blocks within this neighborhood will increase the odds of crime incidence. Empirically it uses crime incidence data from the local police in Mexico City and census data from the National Institute of Statistics. The study shows that crime opportunity theory gives a better fit to the data, and that a mixed geographically weighted Poisson regression gives more reliable estimates of crime incidence.

### Connected in Crime: The Enduring Effect of Neighborhood Networks on the Spatial Patterning of Violence1
- **Journal:** American Journal of Sociology
- **Year:** 2018
- **DOI:** 10.1086/699217
- **Abstract:** The unequal spatial distribution of crime is an enduring feature of cities. While research suggests that spatial diffusion processes heighten this concentration, the actual mechanisms of diffusion are not well understood as research rarely measures the ways in which people, groups, and behaviors connect neighborhoods. This study considers how a particular behavior, criminal co-offending, creates direct and indirect pathways between neighborhoods. Analyzing administrative records and survey data, the authors find that individual acts of co-offending link together to create a “network of neighborhoods,” facilitating the diffusion of crime over time and across space and, in so doing, create pathways between all Chicago neighborhoods. Statistical analyses demonstrate that these neighborhood networks are (1) stable over time; (2) generated by important structural characteristics, social processes, and endogenous network properties; and (3) a better predictor of the geographic distribution of crime than traditional spatial models.
