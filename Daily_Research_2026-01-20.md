## 1. THE ECONOMICS OF SPATIAL MOBILITY: THEORY AND EVIDENCE USING SMARTPHONE DATA
- **Authors:** Y. Miyauchi, Kentaro Nakajima, Stephen J. Redding
- **Journal:** Quarterly Journal of Economics
- **Date:** 2025-08-08
- **DOI:** 10.1093/qje/qjaf038
- **Abstract:** 
 We develop a tractable quantitative framework for modelling the rich patterns of spatial mobility observed in smartphone data. We show that travel is frequently undertaken as part of a travel itinerary, defined as a journey starting and ending at home that can include more than one intermediate stop on a given day. We show that these travel itineraries provide microfoundations for consumption externalities and generate both complementarity and substitutability between locations. We show that the consumption externalities implied by travel itineraries are central to matching quasi-experimental evidence from the shift to WFH. We find that these consumption externalities are key drivers of the agglomeration of economic activity in central cities and shape the relative welfare gains from alternative transport improvements in favor of investments in central cities.

## 3. Assessing the Number of Criteria in GIS‐Based Multicriteria Evaluation: A Machine Learning Approach
- **Authors:** Lan Qing Zhao, S. Dragićević, Shivanand Balram, Liliana Perez

- **Date:** 2025-03-27
- **DOI:** 10.1111/gean.70004
- **Abstract:** The analytical hierarchy process (AHP) is a widely used approach and a decision rule to derive criteria weights in geographic information system‐based multi‐criteria evaluation (GIS‐MCE). However, one limitation of the AHP method is that it constrains the number of criteria that can be meaningfully weighted to typically seven to nine criteria. Recently, machine learning (ML) techniques have emerged as a compelling alternative for deriving criteria weights. This research aims to assess the capabilities of ML‐MCE in handling a larger number of criteria and is specifically applied to a case study of urban suitability analysis. The random forest (RF) ML technique is used to evaluate the ability of the MCE method to handle up to 27 criteria. Geospatial data from the Metro Vancouver Region, Canada, are used, with the criteria subdivided into 11 groups starting with the most basic seven criteria and incrementally adding two new criteria per group. The results indicate the RF‐ML approach can manage a larger number of criteria compared to the traditional AHP approach, with 15 criteria providing a meaningful upper threshold, demonstrating its potential to accommodate a wider range of stakeholder preferences for complex urban suitability analysis contexts.

## 4. Geographical Gaussian Process Regression: A Spatial Machine‐Learning Model Based on Spatial Similarity
- **Authors:** Zhenzhi Jiao, Ran Tao
- **Journal:** Geographical Analysis
- **Date:** 2025-03-10
- **DOI:** 10.1111/gean.12423
- **Abstract:** This study proposes a new spatial machine‐learning model called geographical Gaussian process regression (GGPR). GGPR is extended from Gaussian process regression (GPR) by adopting the principle of spatial similarity for calibration, and it is designed to conduct spatial prediction and exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA). GGPR addresses several key challenges in spatial machine learning. First, as a probabilistic model, GGPR avoids the conflict between spatial autocorrelation and the assumption of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), thus enhancing the model's objectivity and reliability in spatial prediction. Second, GGPR is suitable for small‐sample prediction, a task that most existing models struggle with. Finally, when integrated with GeoShapley, GGPR is an explainable model that can measure spatial effects and explain the outcomes. Evaluated on two distinct datasets, GGPR demonstrates superior predictive performance compared to other popular machine‐learning models across various sampling ratios, with its advantage becoming especially evident with smaller sample sizes. As an ESDA model, GGPR demonstrates enhanced accuracy, better computational efficiency, and a comparable ability to measure spatial effects against both multiscale geographically weighted regression and geographical random forests. In short, GGPR offers spatial data scientists a new method for predicting and exploring complex geographical processes.

## 5. The Modifiable Areal Unit Problem in Political Science
- **Authors:** Dong Wook Lee, Melissa Rogers, H. Soifer
- **Journal:** Political Analysis
- **Date:** 2025-02-18
- **DOI:** 10.1017/pan.2025.2
- **Abstract:** 
 Building on the availability of geospatial data, improvements in mapping software, and innovations in spatial statistics, political scientists are increasingly taking geography seriously. As we adopt the tools of geographers, we must also consider the methodological challenges they have identified. We focus on the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP)—the idea that the size of aggregate spatial units and the location of their borders affect the empirical results we obtain. We first describe the logic of the MAUP, and then demonstrate the MAUP through simulations, showing MAUP-related inconsistency in regression results in randomly generated and real-world data. We identify MAUP concerns, and best practices, in top journals in political science. We conclude by suggesting how scholars may respond in theoretical and empirical terms to concerns about validity and reliability that arise from the MAUP.

## 6. A Machine Learning Approach to Analyzing Crime Concentration: The Case of New York City
- **Authors:** Keungoui Kim, Young-An Kim
- **Journal:** Justice quarterly
- **Date:** 2024-10-04
- **DOI:** 10.1080/07418825.2024.2401938
- **Abstract:** Abstract Building upon prior work, we propose an alternative way to look at the pattern of spatial crime concentration and temporal stability of it. We first identify a high-crime cluster using the sample block groups in New York City by employing a k-means clustering method. We then examine the temporal stability of the high-crime cluster over time. We also longitudinally assess how our high-crime cluster classification is associated with the actual amount of crime while accounting for the measures of social and physical environments. We observed that about 6–12% of total areas are identified to be in the high-crime cluster. We also found that block groups identified to be high-crime cluster in one year are more likely to be that way in the next year. We hope future research may consider using data-driven approaches to expand understanding of spatial and temporal crime patterns.

## 11. Explaining Differences in Voting Patterns across Voting Domains Using Hierarchical Bayesian Models
- **Authors:** E. Lipman, Scott Moser, Abel Rodriguez
- **Journal:** Political Analysis
- **Date:** 2023-12-22
- **DOI:** 10.1017/pan.2025.10014
- **Abstract:** 
 Spatial voting models are widely used in political science to analyze legislators’ preferences and voting behavior. Traditional models assume that legislators’ ideal points are static across different types of votes. This article extends the Bayesian spatial voting model to incorporate hierarchical Bayesian methods, allowing for the identification of covariates that explain differences in legislators’ ideal points across voting domains. We apply this model to procedural and final passage votes in the U.S. House of Representatives from the 93rd through 113th Congresses. Our findings indicate that legislators in the minority party and those representing moderate constituencies are more likely to exhibit different ideal points between procedural and final passage votes. This research advances the methodology of ideal point estimation by simultaneously scaling ideal points and explaining variation in these points, providing a more nuanced understanding of legislative voting behavior.

## 12. The urbanisation of controlled environment agriculture: Why does it matter for urban studies?
- **Authors:** Simon Marvin, Lauren Rickards, Jonathan Rutherford
- **Journal:** Urban studies
- **Date:** 2023-10-09
- **DOI:** 10.1177/00420980231200991
- **Abstract:** This paper critically examines why urban studies should be interested in the emergence of controlled environment agriculture. Over the last decade, there has been significant commercial and urban policy interest in controlled environment agriculture systems for producing food in enclosed environments. Furthermore, there has been a significant expansion in research publications on urban controlled environment agriculture, stressing the novel character of these systems and the complex relationships with the conventional concerns of urban agriculture. The paper subjects these claims to critical scrutiny and then reconceptualises urban controlled environment agriculture as an emergent urban infrastructure of artificial, highly productive microclimates and ecosystems for non-human life designed to increase the productive use of ‘surplus or under-utilised’ urban spaces. We argue that controlled environment agriculture tries to secure food production through three spatial–temporal fixes: (1) the enclosure move – holding food closer by substituting the increasingly hostile outdoors for the controlled indoors in order to optimise yield, quality, efficiency and the ‘cleanness’ of the food; (2) the urban move – holding food closer to the city by substituting rural agricultural space for urban space to shorten supply chains and thereby help secure food production and improve its green credentials; and (3) combining 1 and 2, the urban interiorisation move – holding food yet closer still by moving food production into city buildings and intricate infrastructural systems, increasing control by securing total environments. In these ways, the paper shows how urban controlled environment agriculture selectively extends existing logics of urban and rural agriculture and identifies the future research challenges for urban studies.

## 13. Integrating Data Across Misaligned Spatial Units
- **Authors:** Y. Zhukov, Jason S. Byers, Marty Davidson, Ken Kollman
- **Journal:** Political Analysis
- **Date:** 2023-03-23
- **DOI:** 10.1017/pan.2023.5
- **Abstract:** 
 Theoretical units of interest often do not align with the spatial units at which data are available. This problem is pervasive in political science, particularly in subnational empirical research that requires integrating data across incompatible geographic units (e.g., administrative areas, electoral constituencies, and grid cells). Overcoming this challenge requires researchers not only to align the scale of empirical and theoretical units, but also to understand the consequences of this change of support for measurement error and statistical inference. We show how the accuracy of transformed values and the estimation of regression coefficients depend on the degree of nesting (i.e., whether units fall completely and neatly inside each other) and on the relative scale of source and destination units (i.e., aggregation, disaggregation, and hybrid). We introduce simple, nonparametric measures of relative nesting and scale, as ex ante indicators of spatial transformation complexity and error susceptibility. Using election data and Monte Carlo simulations, we show that these measures are strongly predictive of transformation quality across multiple change-of-support methods. We propose several validation procedures and provide open-source software to make transformation options more accessible, customizable, and intuitive.

## 14. Modeling Spatial Heterogeneity and Historical Persistence: Nazi Concentration Camps and Contemporary Intolerance
- **Authors:** Thomas B. Pepinsky, S. Goodman, Conrad Ziller
- **Journal:** American Political Science Review
- **Date:** 2023-03-02
- **DOI:** 10.1017/S0003055423000072
- **Abstract:** A wealth of recent research in comparative politics examines how spatial variation in historical conditions shapes modern political outcomes. In an article in the American Political Science Review, Homola, Pereira, and Tavits argue that Germans who live nearer to former Nazi concentration camps are more likely to display out-group intolerance. Clarifying the conceptual foundations of posttreatment bias and reviewing the historical record on postwar state creation in Germany, we argue that state-level differences confound the relationship between distance to camps and out-group intolerance. Using publicly available European Values Survey data and electoral results from 2017, we find no consistent evidence that distance to camps is related to contemporary values. Our findings have implications for literatures on historical persistence, causal inference with spatial data, Holocaust studies, and outgroup tolerance.

## 15. Vulnerability in the Neighborhood: A Study of Perceived Control Over Victimization
- **Authors:** C. Keel, Rebecca Wickes, Murray Lee, Jonathan Jackson, K. Benier
- **Journal:** Journal of research in crime and delinquency
- **Date:** 2023-02-20
- **DOI:** 10.1177/00224278221150280
- **Abstract:** Objectives: We test which neighborhood characteristics are associated with perceived control over victimization and how the neighborhood context explains differences between women's and men's perceived control. Methods: Drawing upon administrative data and a survey of 2,862 participants living in 80 neighborhoods in Victoria, Australia, we make a distinction between broader characteristics of the neighborhood, community processes, and gendered neighborhood dynamics. We run a series of multilevel mixed effects regression models to examine the relationship between individual-level perceptions of control over victimization and the neighborhood. Results: Results indicate that a concentration of low-income households in the neighborhood is associated with residents reporting less control over their victimization. Furthermore, the interaction revealed higher crime in the neighborhood lowered women's perceived control while heightening men's perceived control over victimization. Conclusions: Gender remained strongly associated with perceived control over victimization throughout the analysis despite extensive testing of general and gendered neighborhood conditions that may account for differences between women and men. The results found that overall crime rates were the only feature that assisted in explaining the differences between women and men. Future research must seek to better capture the environmental conditions that can account for the difference between women's and men's perceptions.

## 16. Centring the periphery in urban studies: Notes towards a research agenda on peripheral centralities
- **Authors:** N. Phelps, P. Maginn, R. Keil
- **Journal:** Urban studies
- **Date:** 2022-12-14
- **DOI:** 10.1177/00420980221135418
- **Abstract:** Based on presentations across two days as part of an Urban Studies Foundation-funded seminar series, we elaborate a thematic agenda for considering the centrality of urban peripheries. We move beyond a typology of suburban centres to depict senses of peripheral centrality in terms of: their pervasiveness; their visibility across multiple scales; their underlying social relations; the agency exerted in their imagining and production, and the associated policy mobility.

## 17. The spatial (in)stability of mental health calls for police service
- **Authors:** Jacek Koziarski
- **Journal:** Criminology &amp; Public Policy
- **Date:** 2022-12-09
- **DOI:** 10.1111/1745-9133.12612
- **Abstract:** Research summary Policy implications Inspired by studies on crime concentration, scholars have begun examining the spatial patterns of other issues under the police mandate, such as calls for service involving persons with perceived mental illness (PwPMI). While findings show that PwPMI calls for service concentrate in a few number of places, we do not know whether the concentration of these calls fall within a narrow bandwidth of spatial units nor whether these calls are spatially stable. Drawing on 7 years of calls for service data from the Barrie Police Service, this study tests for the temporal stability of PwPMI call for service concentrations at two units of spatial analysis and applies a longitudinal variation of the Spatial Point Pattern Test to assess the spatial stability of these calls at both the global and local levels. The results reveal that concentrations of PwPMI calls for service not only fall within a narrow proportional bandwidth of spatial units, but are spatially stable, even during the COVID‐19 pandemic.Existing police‐ and community‐based efforts that respond to PwPMI in the community are tasked with responding to crises that could have been prevented with timelier intervention. Drawing from crime‐focused, place‐based policing strategies whose deployment is informed by the spatial concentration of crime, scholars have similarly argued that knowledge on where PwPMI calls for service concentrate can be leveraged to inform and deploy place‐based efforts whose focus is to assist PwPMI in a proactive capacity. The findings of the present study further substantiates the deployment of PwPMI‐focused police‐ and community‐based resources as proactive, place‐based efforts. In doing so, these efforts could not only prevent mental health crises from occurring but could prevent future police‐involved calls for service and thus reduce the footprint of the police in the lives of PwPMI in a reactive capacity.

## 18. The spatial dynamics of commercial burglary during the COVID-19 lockdown in San Francisco
- **Authors:** Ha-neul Yim, Jordan R. Riddell
- **Journal:** Journal of Experimental Criminology
- **Date:** 2022-08-18
- **DOI:** 10.1007/s11292-022-09530-0
- **Abstract:** Purpose This paper investigated the impact of COVID-19 stay-at-home regulations on the spatial distribution of commercial burglary in San Francisco. Method Geocoded commercial burglary data for 2003–2021 from San Francisco were analyzed using the Andresen Spatial Point Pattern Test to examine potential spatial movement in commercial burglary. Results Concentrations of commercial burglary spatially shifted following the emergence of COVID-19 and the subsequent stay-at-home orders. Original hot spots experienced a relative decrease in commercial burglary, and crime spread out throughout the city. These spatial changes in commercial burglary appear to be related to variations in guardianship and criminal opportunity. Conclusion These findings suggest that the dramatic shifts in routine activities resulting from the COVID-19 policies could disrupt spatial burglary patterns, especially burglary clustering. Law enforcement should consider the spatial dynamics of commercial burglary, as well as land use heterogeneity, to effectively respond to crime during periods of social distancing and business shutdowns.

## 19. Paws on the Street: Neighborhood-Level Concentration of Households with Dogs and Urban Crime
- **Authors:** Nicolo P. Pinchak, Christopher R. Browning, Bethany Boettner, Catherine A. Calder, Jake Tarrence
- **Journal:** Social forces; a scientific medium of social study and interpretation
- **Date:** 2022-06-25
- **DOI:** 10.1093/sf/soac059
- **Abstract:** Abstract:The formative work of Jane Jacobs underscores the combination of "eyes on the street" and trust between residents in deterring crime. Nevertheless, little research has assessed the effects of residential street monitoring on crime due partly to a lack of data measuring this process. We argue that neighborhood-level rates of households with dogs captures part of the residential street monitoring process core to Jacobs' hypotheses and test whether this measure is inversely associated with property and violent crime rates. Data from a large-scale marketing survey of Columbus, OH, USA residents (2013; n = 43,078) are used to measure census block group-level (n = 595) rates of households with dogs. Data from the Adolescent Health and Development in Context study are used to measure neighborhood-level rates of trust. Consistent with Jacobs' hypotheses, results indicate that neighborhood concentration of households with dogs is inversely associated with robbery, homicide, and, to a less consistent degree, aggravated assault rates within neighborhoods high in trust. In contrast, results for property crime suggest that the inverse association of dog concentration is independent of levels of neighborhood trust. These associations are observed net of controls for neighborhood sociodemographic characteristics, temporally lagged crime, and spatial lags of trust and dog concentration. This study offers suggestive evidence of crime deterrent benefits of local street monitoring and dog presence and calls attention to the contribution of pets to other facets of neighborhood social organization.

## 20. From Residential Neighborhood to Activity Space: The Effects of Educational Segregation on Crime and Their Moderation by Social Context
- **Authors:** Yanji Zhang, Liang Cai, Guangwen Song, Lin Liu, Chunwu Zhu
- **Journal:** Annals of the American Association of Geographers
- **Date:** 2022-06-16
- **DOI:** 10.1080/24694452.2022.2060793
- **Abstract:** The segregation–crime relationship is a classic topic in sociology and crime geography, yet existing literature mainly focuses on the impact of racial segregation at the global scale. Little is known about the impact of local segregation of other socioeconomic characteristics such as education level, an important segregation factor for racially homogenous countries like China. Also unknown is their impact beyond the residential domain. Using the Baidu Map Location-Based Service population data set and court records in 863 local geographic units of the central urban area of Beijing during 2018 and 2019, this study uncovers the spatial pattern of segregation between people with and without a bachelor’s degree measured in the residential space and activity space and further investigates the influence of these two types of educational segregation and their interaction effects with social context on theft and violent crime. Results show less segregation in the activity space than in the residential space. Both types of segregation, however, significantly increase the risk of theft and violence, with activity space–based segregation more consequential. Moreover, the positive segregation–crime link is moderated by the local social context measured by the educational composition among residents and the ambient population. Compared with residential segregation, activity space–based segregation is more detrimental for places dominated by the less educated. Our results highlight the elevated influence of segregation on safety beyond the residential space, especially for areas clustered with the less educated ambient population.
