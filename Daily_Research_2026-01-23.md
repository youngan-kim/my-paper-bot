## 1. Explaining Differences in Voting Patterns across Voting Domains Using Hierarchical Bayesian Models
- **Authors:** E. Lipman, Scott Moser, Abel Rodriguez
- **Journal:** Political Analysis
- **Date:** 2023-12-22
- **Abstract:** 
 Spatial voting models are widely used in political science to analyze legislators’ preferences and voting behavior. Traditional models assume that legislators’ ideal points are static across different types of votes. This article extends the Bayesian spatial voting model to incorporate hierarchical Bayesian methods, allowing for the identification of covariates that explain differences in legislators’ ideal points across voting domains. We apply this model to procedural and final passage votes in the U.S. House of Representatives from the 93rd through 113th Congresses. Our findings indicate that legislators in the minority party and those representing moderate constituencies are more likely to exhibit different ideal points between procedural and final passage votes. This research advances the methodology of ideal point estimation by simultaneously scaling ideal points and explaining variation in these points, providing a more nuanced understanding of legislative voting behavior.

## 2. STADL Up! The Spatiotemporal Autoregressive Distributed Lag Model for TSCS Data Analysis
- **Authors:** S. Cook, Jude C. Hays, R. Franzese
- **Journal:** American Political Science Review
- **Date:** 2022-04-21
- **Abstract:** Time-series cross-section (TSCS) data are prevalent in political science, yet many distinct challenges presented by TSCS data remain underaddressed. We focus on how dependence in both space and time complicates estimating either spatial or temporal dependence, dynamics, and effects. Little is known about how modeling one of temporal or cross-sectional dependence well while neglecting the other affects results in TSCS analysis. We demonstrate analytically and through simulations how misspecification of either temporal or spatial dependence inflates estimates of the other dimension’s dependence and thereby induces biased estimates and tests of other covariate effects. Therefore, we recommend the spatiotemporal autoregressive distributed lag (STADL) model with distributed lags in both space and time as an effective general starting point for TSCS model specification. We illustrate with two example reanalyses and provide R code to facilitate researchers’ implementation—from automation of common spatial-weights matrices (W) through estimated spatiotemporal effects/response calculations—for their own TSCS analyses.

## 3. Concentrated Burdens: How Self-Interest and Partisanship Shape Opinion on Opioid Treatment Policy
- **Authors:** Justin de Benedictis-Kessner, Michael Hankinson
- **Journal:** American Political Science Review
- **Date:** 2019-07-25
- **Abstract:** When does self-interest influence public opinion on contentious public policies? The bulk of theory in political science suggests that self-interest is only a minor force in public opinion. Using nationally representative survey data, we show how financial and spatial self-interest and partisanship all shape public opinion on opioid treatment policy. We find that a majority of respondents support a redistributive funding model for treatment programs, while treatment funded by taxation based on a community’s overdose rate is less popular. Moreover, financial self-interest cross-pressures lower-income Republicans, closing the partisan gap in support by more than half. We also experimentally test how the spatial burden of siting treatment clinics alters policy preferences. People across the political spectrum are less supportive when construction of a clinic is proposed closer to their home. These results highlight how partisanship and self-interest interact in shaping preferences on public policy with concentrated burdens.

## 4. Hate in the Machine: Anti-Black and Anti-Muslim Social Media Posts as Predictors of Offline Racially and Religiously Aggravated Crime
- **Authors:** M. Williams, P. Burnap, Amir Javed, Han Liu, Sefa Ozalp
- **Journal:** British Journal of Criminology
- **Date:** 2019-07-23
- **Abstract:** 
 National governments now recognize online hate speech as a pernicious social problem. In the wake of political votes and terror attacks, hate incidents online and offline are known to peak in tandem. This article examines whether an association exists between both forms of hate, independent of ‘trigger’ events. Using Computational Criminology that draws on data science methods, we link police crime, census and Twitter data to establish a temporal and spatial association between online hate speech that targets race and religion, and offline racially and religiously aggravated crimes in London over an eight-month period. The findings renew our understanding of hate crime as a process, rather than as a discrete event, for the digital age.

## 5. Modeling Crime in an Uptown Neighborhood: The Case of Santa Fe in Mexico City
- **Authors:** Carlos Vilalta, Gustavo Fondevila
- **Journal:** Papers in applied geography
- **Date:** 2019-02-23
- **Abstract:** Abstract What are the correlates of crime incidence in an uptown and wealthy neighborhood? This article focuses on the Santa Fe neighborhood in Mexico City as a case study to answer to this question. Theoretically, it makes use of crime pattern and social disorganization theories. It is argued that crime incidence in an uptown neighborhood can also be modeled based on variables that represent crime generators and crime attractors. It is also argued that the existence of structurally disadvantaged census blocks within this neighborhood will increase the odds of crime incidence. Empirically it uses crime incidence data from the local police in Mexico City and census data from the National Institute of Statistics. The study shows that crime opportunity theory gives a better fit to the data, and that a mixed geographically weighted Poisson regression gives more reliable estimates of crime incidence.

## 6. The Concentration of Crime at Place in Montreal and Toronto
- **Authors:** R. Boivin, Silas Nogueira de Melo
- **Journal:** Canadian Journal of Criminology and Criminal Justice
- **Date:** 2019-02-20
- **Abstract:** Abstract:The identification of hot spots of crime – areas of high crime intensity – is of primary importance for crime prevention strategies. While the notion of crime hot spots is well accepted in Anglo-Saxon criminology, its empirical foundation is largely drawn from U.S. studies, and comparatively little literature is available for other countries, including Canada. Taking advantage of their respective “open data” initiatives, this study compares the spatial pattern of the two largest Canadian cities, Montreal and Toronto. The authors also review and empirically explore five propositions from the existing literature: (1) that a small proportion of places account for a large proportion of recorded criminal incidents; (2) that crime concentration is inversely correlated with the size of geographic units; (3) that crime concentration drastically varies whether all places or only places where at least one crime occurred are considered; (4) that different hot spots are identified at particular times of the day; and (5) that hot spots of different crime types do not overlap much. Both Toronto and Montreal appear to be very similar in terms of crime concentrations and hot spots. Additionally, this study provides preliminary support for the idea that findings from other countries can be generalized to the Canadian context.Résumé:L’identification de secteurs sensibles – des secteurs où l’intensité du crime est élevée – est de première importance dans les stratégies de prévention du crime. Tandis que l’idée de secteurs sensibles est acceptée dans la terminologie anglo-saxonne, ses fondements empiriques sont surtout tirés d’études américaines et comparativement peu de littérature est disponible dans d’autres pays, notamment le Canada. En tirant profit de leurs projets respectifs de « données ouvertes », cette étude compare les motifs spatiaux des deux plus grandes villes canadiennes : Montréal et Toronto. De plus, les auteurs révisent et explorent de manière empirique les cinq propositions découlant de la littérature existante, notamment que : (1) une petite proportion d’endroits explique une grande proportion d’incidents criminels enregistrés; (2) la concentration du crime est en corrélation inverse avec la taille des unités géographiques; (3) la concentration du crime varie de façon importante, peu importe si tous les endroits où seuls les endroits où au moins un crime a eu lieu sont considérés; (4) différents secteurs sensibles sont identifiés à des heures de la journée particulière; et (5) les secteurs sensibles de différents types de crime ne se chevauchent pas souvent. Toronto et Montréal semblent être similaires en matière de concentrations du crime et de secteurs sensibles. De plus, cette étude fournit un appui préliminaire à l’idée que les résultats des autres pays peuvent être généralisés pour s’inscrire dans le contexte canadien.

## 7. Funding, financing and governing urban infrastructures
- **Authors:** P. O'brien, P. O’Neill, A. Pike
- **Journal:** Urban studies
- **Date:** 2019-02-14
- **Abstract:** This Special Issue aims to further understanding and explanation of the funding, financing and governing of urban infrastructure amidst its engagements with contemporary financialisation. Drawing upon empirical material from international cases from Europe, North America, Africa and Asia, it identifies critical issues to advance work in this area. These themes concern: the impacts of financialisation upon shifting the definitions and conceptualisations of urban infrastructure; the worth of adopting more actor-oriented and grounded approaches to financialisation; the importance of affording greater recognition to national and local states as the objects and agents of financialising relations, processes and practices; the substance and ramifications of the emergent informalisation of infrastructure policy-making and governance; and, the implications of financialisation for the evolving and uneven landscapes of urban infrastructure provision. The arguments are, first, that how infrastructure is funded, financed and governed is integral to explaining socially and spatially uneven infrastructural provision and its urban development ramifications; and second, the engagements of urban infrastructure with contemporary financialisation have become central in such accounts. Future research avenues are identified. These comprise: identifying exactly how revenues are generated from infrastructure assets; specifying the relations of financialisation with other processes such as ‘assetisation’, ‘marketisation’ and privatisation; extending the geographical and comparative reach of current studies; elaborating the spaces of regulation in negotiating and accommodating infrastructure financialisation; and, scrutinising the roles of decentralised powers and resources in financialising urban infrastructure and exploring its alternatives.

## 8. The Spatial Effect of Police Foot Patrol on Crime Patterns: A Local Analysis
- **Authors:** Martin A. Andresen, Jen-Li Shen
- **Journal:** International journal of offender therapy and comparative criminology
- **Date:** 2019-02-06
- **Abstract:** A foot patrol program was implemented in Lower Lonsdale, British Columbia, in the summer of 2010 and continues today. As a part of assessing the foot patrol’s effect on crime in the neighbourhood, the spatial similarity was examined by comparing the crime pattern before the foot patrol initiative (2007-2009) with the crime pattern during the foot patrol program (2010-2012). Considering these baseline and treatment data sets and a spatial point pattern test, the spatial similarity between two data sets is analyzed. In general, the continued presence of foot patrol appears to have created a concentration of crime in specific areas, rather than a diffusion effect. The areas that continued to experience increased crime during foot patrol presence were often in the catchment area, suggesting displacement does occur, or along the border between the catchment and primary patrol area.

## 9. Reconfiguring urban governance in an age of rising city networks: A research agenda
- **Authors:** K. Davidson, Lars Coenen, M. Acuto, B. Gleeson
- **Journal:** Urban studies
- **Date:** 2019-01-31
- **Abstract:** Networked urban governance is emerging as a major feature of metropolitan strategy and activity. The field of urban studies is yet to deeply engage in the debates on the new forms of cross national networking that are potentially framing and reframing urban governance and strategy. Yet this dimension of urban governance can no longer go unnoticed. In this article we draw together insights from the extant literature into a research agenda on reconfiguring urban governance. We propose a research agenda centred on three themes: the political economy of ‘new-gen’ networks, especially in relation to the role of economic power in determining participation and influence; the knowledge dynamics in city networks in understanding the socio-spatial configurations that are underpinning the decision-making processes and outcomes; and the implications of city networks for traditional institutions that have in the past shaped cities’ strategies, development and government. Our commentary considers and links these emergent themes, noting how these bear serious and urgent consideration for mainstream urban studies.

## 10. Looking Through Broken Windows: The Impact of Neighborhood Disorder on Aggression and Fear of Crime Is an Artifact of Research Design
- **Authors:** D. O’Brien, Chelsea Farrell, Brandon C. Welsh
- **Journal:** annual review of criminology
- **Date:** 2019-01-14
- **Abstract:** Broken windows theory (BWT) has heavily influenced social science and policy over the past 30 years. It posits that disorder in neighborhoods leads to elevated crime by inviting additional criminal activity and by discouraging the positive social behavior that prevents crime. Scholars have debated the veracity of BWT, and here we conduct a meta-analysis of 96 studies to examine the effects of disorder on residents’ ( a) general proclivities for aggressive behavior and ( b) perceptions of and attitudes toward their neighborhood (e.g., fear of crime), with particular attention to aspects of research design that might confound causal inference. We found no consistent evidence that disorder induces greater aggression or more negative attitudes toward the neighborhood. Studies that found such effects disproportionately utilized weaker research designs that omit key correlates or confound perceptions of disorder with other neighborhood attitudes. We explore implications for theory, research, and policy.

## 11. Thinking with and beyond the informal–formal relation in urban thought
- **Authors:** Colin Mcfarlane
- **Journal:** Urban studies
- **Date:** 2019-01-08
- **Abstract:** This commentary to the special issue on ‘Transcending (in)formal urbanism’ reviews key threads common across the issue and opens up questions as to the work that the informal–formal dynamic does for urban studies. It points out the general agreement in that none of the papers rejects the utility of the category of informal and that the terms informal and formal still have value and utility. In doing so, the special issue articles offer three key contributions to demonstrate the ways in which the informal either composes or becomes a close partner to the formal, de-link informality from its more commonplace registers, and sketch how the formal and informal have always been blurred in practice. Centrally, this calls for a critical reflection on the structures of thought through which the informal–formal relation emerges. It advances an understanding of how informal and formal operate as a kind of ‘intellectual governmentality’ reiterating the same ways of seeing, carving up, and analysing the city, getting in the way of our ability to research urbanism differently. The appreciation of the informal–formal dynamic is situated as part of the challenge to build a more global urban studies that works with multiple ways of knowing and researching. To what extent does remaining within a structure of thought around the informal–formal relation enable or get in the way of that? Borrowing alternatives from movements to ‘provincialising’ that structure of thought, this commentary calls for a renewed interest in the potential, and limits, of the informal–formal inheritance in urban thought.

## 12. (Under What Conditions) Do Politicians Reward Their Supporters? Evidence from Kenya’s Constituencies Development Fund
- **Authors:** J. A. Harris, Daniel N. Posner, Darin Christensen, Guy Grossman, Robert Mattes, JessicaPreece, ChrisTausanovich
- **Journal:** American Political Science Review
- **Date:** 2018-12-18
- **Abstract:** We leverage innovative spatial modeling techniques and data on the precise geo-locations of more than 32,000 Constituency Development Fund (CDF) projects in Kenya to test whether Members of Parliament (MPs) reward their supporters. We find only weak evidence that MPs channel projects disproportionately to areas inhabited by their political allies, once we control for other factors that affect where projects are placed, such as population density, poverty rates, ethnic demographics, and distance to paved roads. Notwithstanding this result, we find evidence for cross-constituency variation in political targeting, driven in large part by the spatial segregation of the MP’s supporters and opponents. Our findings challenge the conventional wisdom about the centrality of clientelistic transfers in Africa and underscore how local conditions generate particular incentives and opportunities for the strategic allocation of political goods. We also highlight the benefits and challenges of analyzing allocations at the project level rather than aggregated to the administrative unit.

## 13. SKYNET: An R package for generating air passenger networks for urban studies
- **Authors:** Filipe Teixeira, B. Derudder
- **Journal:** Urban studies
- **Date:** 2018-12-11
- **Abstract:** There is a long tradition of urban studies invoking air transport data either for tackling the city/air transport-nexus head on (e.g. in research on the causality between urban-economic development and air transport connectivity) or as a secondary data source (e.g. in research mapping city networks). However, air transport statistics rarely come in a format that allows for their immediate scrutiny in light of the research questions at hand, so that handling and transforming these data often involves both practical challenges and considerable effort. Against this backdrop, this article introduces ‘SKYNET’, a flexible R package that allows generating bespoke air transport statistics for urban studies based on publicly available data from the Bureau of Transport Statistics (BTS) in the United States. The basic elements of the package are explained, after which we demonstrate its usefulness by showing its potential for addressing research questions emerging in the literatures on 1) evolving urban landscapes of air travel accessibility, and 2) differences in intercity air transport networks by scale, types and season. We argue that this R package has the potential to become the backbone of a range of easily navigable tools overcoming some of the main methodological challenges researchers face when handling complex airline data in an urban context.

## 14. The street level and beyond: The impact of ethnic diversity on neighborhood cohesion and fear of crime among Dutch natives and nonnatives
- **Authors:** Iris Glas, G. Engbersen, E. Snel
- **Journal:** Journal of Urban Affairs
- **Date:** 2018-12-10
- **Abstract:** ABSTRACT Ethnic diversity is increasing in most Western societies. Research suggests that these increasing levels of diversity could result in less neighborhood cohesion and more fear of crime. In this article, we examine both hypothesized outcomes of ethnic diversity, using survey data of the Dutch Safety Monitor 2014 in combination with detailed register data. The effects of diversity on neighborhood cohesion and fear of crime are simultaneously assessed at 3 spatial levels: districts, neighborhoods, and streets. The results of the multilevel analyses show that ethnic diversity is modestly related to less neighborhood cohesion and more fear of crime at specific spatial levels. The patterns are largely similar for natives and nonnatives. We found, in addition, that recent increases in diversity are unable to explain differences in neighborhood cohesion and fear of crime. Altogether, our study provides a nuanced understanding of diversity effects in the Dutch context.

## 15. Leveraging Bogotá: Sustainable development, global philanthropy and the rise of urban solutionism
- **Authors:** Sergio Montero
- **Journal:** Urban studies
- **Date:** 2018-12-10
- **Abstract:** The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is marked by the consolidation of sustainability as a key guiding principle and an emphasis on cities as a potential solution to global development problems. However, in the absence of an agreement on how to implement sustainable development in cities, a set of urban policy solutions and ‘best practices’ became the vehicles through which the sustainable development agenda is spreading worldwide. This article shows that the rapid circulation of Bogotá as a model of sustainable transport since the 2000s reflects an increasing focus of the international development apparatus on urban policy solutions as an arena to achieve global development impacts, what I call the ‘leveraging cities’ logic in this article. This logic emerges at a particular historical conjuncture characterised by: (1) the rising power of global philanthropy to set development agendas; (2) the generalisation of solutionism as a strategy of action among development and philanthropic organisations; and (3) the increasing attention on cities as solutions for global development problems, particularly around sustainability and climate change. By connecting urban policy mobilities debates with development studies this article seeks to unpack the emergence, and the limits, of ‘leveraging cities’ as a proliferating global development practice. These urban policy solutions are far from being a clear framework of action. Rather, their circulation becomes a ‘quick fix’ to frame the problem of sustainable development given the unwillingness of development and philanthropic organisations to intervene in the structural factors and multiple scales that produce environmental degradation and climate change.

## 16. Racial or Spatial Voting? The Effects of Candidate Ethnicity and Ethnic Group Endorsements in Local Elections
- **Authors:** Cheryl Boudreau, Christopher S. Elmendorf, Scott A. Mackenzie
- **Journal:** American Journal of Political Science
- **Date:** 2018-12-03
- **Abstract:** With the growth of Latino and Asian American populations, candidates frequently must appeal to diverse electorates. Strategies for doing so include emphasizing candidates’ racial/ethnic identity and securing endorsements from racial/ethnic groups. While many scholars focus on candidates’ racial/ethnic attributes, ethnic group endorsements are understudied. Whether such endorsements induce voters to choose ideologically similar candidates (spatial voting), or choose based on race/ethnicity (racial voting) is unclear. We address this question by examining elections in multiethnic local settings. Using original surveys and exit polls, we create comparable measures of candidate and voter ideology, and examine how race/ethnicity and ideology affect voters’ choices. We also embed experiments that manipulate ethnic group endorsements. We find that ideology influences voters’ choices, but that ethnic group endorsements weaken spatial voting. The latter effect among whites is driven by racial/ethnic stereotypes. These reactions explain why some candidates seek such endorsements and why others might prefer to avoid them. Replication Materials: The data, code, and any additional materials required to replicate all analyses in this article are available on the American Journal of Political Science Dataverse within the Harvard Dataverse Network, at: https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/XYUWYJ. The rapid growth of Latino and Asian American populations in recent years has transformed the American electorate and led scholars to speculate about its political ramifications. Latinos account for over half of the total population growth in the United States between 2000 and 2010. The Asian American population grew 43% during this same period, over four times the national rate. While political participation by these groups continues to lag that of whites (Hajnal and Lee 2011; Wong et al. 2011), Latino and Asian American politicians have become a regular, albeit underrepresented, presence in local, state, and federal elections. According to the National Association of Latino Elected Officials, 5,850 Latinos serve in elective offices, and the Asian Pacific Studies Cheryl Boudreau is Associate Professor, Department of Political Science, University of California, Davis, One Shields Avenue, Davis, CA 95616 (clboudreau@ucdavis.edu).

Center lists more than 4,000 Asian Americans holding public offices. Nowhere has the growing strength of Latinos and Asian Americans been more visible than in America’s largest cities. Latinos comprise nearly one-third of residents in America’s 15 largest cities according to the 2010 census, including pluralities in Los Angeles, Houston, San Antonio, Dallas, and San Jose. Asian Americans make up fully 10% of residents in these same cities, up 26% from 2000. Austin, Denver, Los Angeles, Miami, and San Antonio have elected Latino mayors, whereas San Francisco and Oakland have elected Asian American mayors.

## 17. Chronic urban trauma: The slow violence of housing dispossession
- **Authors:** R. Pain
- **Journal:** Urban studies
- **Date:** 2018-11-15
- **Abstract:** This paper sets the idea of slow violence into dialogue with trauma, to understand the practice and legitimisation of the repeated damage done to certain places through state violence. Slow violence (Nixon R (2011) Slow Violence and the Environmentalism of the Poor. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press) describes the ‘attritional lethality’ of many contemporary effects of globalisation. While originating in environmental humanities, it has clear relevance for urban studies. After assessing accounts of the post-traumatic city, the paper draws insights from feminist psychiatry and postcolonial analysis to develop the concept of chronic urban trauma, as a psychological effect of violence involving an ongoing relational dynamic. Reporting from a three-year participatory action research project on the managed decline and disposal of social housing in a former coalmining village in north-east England, the paper discusses the temporal and place-based effects of slow violence. It argues that chronic urban trauma becomes hard-wired in place, enabling retraumatisation while also remaining open to efforts to heal and rebuild.

## 19. Spatiotemporal Modeling of Correlated Small‐Area Outcomes: Analyzing the Shared and Type‐Specific Patterns of Crime and Disorder
- **Authors:** Matthew Quick, Guangquan Li, J. Law
- **Journal:** Geographical Analysis
- **Date:** 2018-10-23
- **Abstract:** This research applies a Bayesian spatio-temporal modeling approach to jointly analyze physical disorder, social disorder, property crime, and violent crime over five years at the small-area scale. Despite crime and disorder outcomes exhibiting similar spatio-temporal patterns, as hypothesized by broken windows and collective efficacy theories, past research often analyzes one outcome and overlooks correlations between related crimes as well as underlying spatial and/or temporal patterns common to multiple crime and disorder types. In this article, the best fitting model partitions the area-specific risk of each type of crime and disorder into one spatial shared component and four type-specific spatial, temporal, and space-time components. The shared component captures the spatial pattern common to physical disorder, social disorder, property crime, and violent crime. Results show that the spatial shared component explains the largest amounts of variability for all types of crime and disorder and that temporal components explained the least. Space-time interaction hotspots are identified via posterior probabilities and are examined to contextualize the broken windows theory. The applications of joint spatio-temporal modeling to ecological crime theories, policing, and urban policy are discussed.

## 20. Understanding urban gentrification through machine learning
- **Authors:** J. Reades, Jordan Henrique de Souza, P. Hubbard
- **Journal:** Urban studies
- **Date:** 2018-09-25
- **Abstract:** Recent developments in the field of machine learning offer new ways of modelling complex socio-spatial processes, allowing us to make predictions about how and where they might manifest in the future. Drawing on earlier empirical and theoretical attempts to understand gentrification and urban change, this paper shows it is possible to analyse existing patterns and processes of neighbourhood change to identify areas likely to experience change in the future. This is evidenced through an analysis of socio-economic transition in London neighbourhoods (based on 2001 and 2011 Census variables) which is used to predict those areas most likely to demonstrate ‘uplift’ or ‘decline’ by 2021. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of such modelling for the understanding of gentrification processes, noting that if qualitative work on gentrification and neighbourhood change is to offer more than a rigorous post-mortem then intensive, qualitative case studies must be confronted with – and complemented by – predictions stemming from other, more extensive approaches. As a demonstration of the capabilities of machine learning, this paper underlines the continuing value of quantitative approaches in understanding complex urban processes such as gentrification.
