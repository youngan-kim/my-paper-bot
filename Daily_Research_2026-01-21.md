## 1. Who Leaves and Who Enters? Flow Measures of Neighborhood Change and Consequences for Neighborhood Crime
- **Authors:** John R. Hipp, Alyssa W. Chamberlain
- **Journal:** Journal of research in crime and delinquency
- **Date:** 2022-03-24
- **Abstract:** Objectives Longitudinal studies of the relationship between neighborhood change and changes in crime typically focus exclusively on the net level of change in key socio-demographic characteristics. Methods We instead propose a demographic accounting strategy that captures the composition of neighborhood change: our measures capture which types of people are more likely to leave, stay, or enter the neighborhood. We use data for 3,325 tracts in the Southern California region over nearly two decades of 2000–2010 and 2010–2017 and construct flow measures based on race/ethnicity; the length of residence of owners and renters; the age structure. Results These flow measures improve the predictive power of the models—implying important theoretical insights. Neighborhoods with higher percentages of middle-aged residents who recently entered the neighborhood exhibit larger increases in violent and property crime. The relative stability of those in the highest crime-prone ages (aged 15–29) is associated with the largest increases in violent and property crime. The greater loss of Black and Asian residents decreased crime while moderate outflows of Latinos increased crime. The mobility of long- and short-term renters was related to crime changes. Conclusions This new technique will likely encourage further theoretical innovation for the neighborhoods and crime literature.

## 2. Is urbanisation in the Global South fundamentally different? Comparative global urban analysis for the 21st century
- **Authors:** Gregory F. Randolph, M. Storper
- **Journal:** Urban studies
- **Date:** 2022-02-08
- **Abstract:** A vigorous debate has emerged in recent years over how to understand cities of the Global South. A pivotal issue in this debate is whether urbanisation processes in the South are so fundamentally different from historical and current urbanisation in the Global North that many of the theories developed from studying the latter have limited utility in application to the former. In this article, we review evidence from a range of disciplines on recent and ongoing urban transitions and urbanisation dynamics in the Global South, attending to features that distinguish the urban South from the urban North. Our reading of the evidence indicates that parts of the Global South may be urbanising along historically and geographically specific trajectories; however, we argue that these differences are best understood through a unified set of global urban theories. Rather than flattening or silencing difference, theories that seek generalisation across time and space sharpen the identification and appreciation of key differences in urbanisation processes. Analysing how the fundamental dynamics of urbanisation recombine and interact with one another in different contexts offers insight into policy challenges that cut across cities, both within and between the Global South and North, as well as context-specific policy issues that arise through the interaction of global urbanisation forces and local specificities.

## 3. How Does Crime-Specific Victimization Impact Fear of Crime in Urban China? The Role of Neighborhood Characteristics
- **Authors:** Fengrui Jing, Lin Liu, Suhong Zhou, Jiaxin Feng
- **Journal:** International journal of offender therapy and comparative criminology
- **Date:** 2021-12-21
- **Abstract:** Past research has failed to find consistent relationships between criminal victimization and fear of crime. Except for neighborhood disorder and crime rate, few studies have examined whether other neighborhood conditions matter the victimization—fear relationship. Using survey data in Guangzhou neighborhoods, the present analysis employs multinomial logistic regression models to examine whether neighborhood characteristics moderate the relationship between violent victimization and fear of violence, and between burglary victimization and fear of burglary, separately. Some aspects of the neighborhood environment do differentially influence victims’ and non-victims’ fear levels. Besides verifying the interaction effect of neighborhood disorder and victimization, the present study finds that neighborhood policing alleviates the harmful effect of violent victimization on fear, while collective efficacy fosters the harmful effect of burglary victimization on fear. This paper underscores the significance of the social context of urban China in explaining the interplay of neighborhood characteristics and victimization on fear of crime.

## 4. Urban studies in India across the millennial turn: Histories and futures
- **Authors:** K. Coelho, A. Sood
- **Journal:** Urban studies
- **Date:** 2021-12-17
- **Abstract:** The millennial turn saw a distinct efflorescence in scholarship on urban India. This essay introduces a Virtual Special Issue on urban studies in India that showcases a selection of articles from the journal’s archives. It traces the disciplinary, thematic and methodological shifts that have marked this millennial turn. On the one hand, the social science of the urban has had a statist bent, reacting to the policy focus on cities as growth engines in the post-liberalisation era. On the other hand, critical urban studies has brought attention to the unregulated, deregulated, unplanned and unintended city produced by dynamic processes of informality acting overtly or covertly against the state’s neoliberal agendas. This introductory essay aims to examine the ways this interplay has unfolded both in the pages of this journal and elsewhere. It locates the Virtual Special Issue selection within a broader review of the state of scholarship in Indian urban studies and marks out areas for productive interventions in the future study of Indian cities.

## 6. Economic Inequality Decomposition and Spatial Pattern of Crime in Indonesia
- **Authors:** Putu Angga Widyastaman, D. Hartono
- **Journal:** Papers in applied geography
- **Date:** 2021-10-14
- **Abstract:** Abstract Rising crime victimization rate in Indonesia shows that crime is still a serious problem in the country. This study aims to identify the relationship between economic inequality and crime rate in Indonesia. It used the decomposed Theil indices, as the measure of inequality based on national household survey panel data, to disentangle the effect of economic inequality into within-district/city and between-district/city economic inequality components. This choice of inequality measure is due to the fact that most of the previous studies regarding economic inequality and crime overlooked the disentanglement between economic inequality effects. Another problem addressed by this study is that the effect of crime is not bounded by administrative boundaries. A high prevalence of crime in a region may cause a criminal spillover to the surrounding regions. To control for this effect, this study also evaluates the spatial effect of interregional crime rates using the panel spatial autoregressive model as the estimation method. The estimation results revealed that both within-region and across-region economic inequalities have substantial increasing impacts on the crime rate.

## 7. Gendered fear of crime in the urban context: A comparative multilevel study of women’s and men’s fear of crime
- **Authors:** Sofia Johansson, Karen Haandrikman
- **Journal:** Journal of Urban Affairs
- **Date:** 2021-06-25
- **Abstract:** ABSTRACT Women generally feel more fearful than men. We study this so-called fear-gender gap, by contributing to a growing body of quantitative gender-sensitive research inspired by feminist theory. We depart from traditional quantitative fear of crime research that fails to examine how determinants of fear of crime impact women and men differently. We use a Dutch governmental survey, linked to neighborhood characteristics, to conduct multilevel modeling using multifaceted sociospatial aspects on individual and neighborhood level, to explain the fear-gender gap in the city of Eindhoven. Findings indicate that the sociospatial environment and the perceptions thereof offer insights into gendered differences in fear. A central finding is that fear of crime among women is particularly complex. We discuss the concept of fear of crime, the importance of feminist theory to inform data gathering in order to further future quantitative research on fear of crime, and make suggestions for future research.

## 8. Geographic disparities in violent crime during the COVID-19 lockdown in Miami-Dade County, Florida, 2018–2020
- **Authors:** Imelda K. Moise, A. Piquero
- **Journal:** Journal of Experimental Criminology
- **Date:** 2021-06-17
- **Abstract:** Abstract Objectives This study uses two cluster detection techniques to identify clusters of violent crime during the 3 months of the 2020 COVID-19 lockdown in Miami-Dade County compared to that during an equivalent period in 2018 and 2019. Methods Violent crime data from the Miami-Dade Central Records Bureau were analyzed. The Local Indicators of Spatial Association statistics and a space‐time permutation statistic were used to identify clusters of violent crimes and outliers, and Global Moran’s I tool was used to assess spatial patterning in violent crime. Neighborhood disadvantage data were obtained from the American Community Survey 5-year estimates linked with arrest locations. Results Violent crime arrests fell by 7.1% in 2020. Arrests were concentrated in predominantly Black disadvantaged neighborhoods in the northern part, and similar results were produced for core clusters by the two cluster techniques with positive global Moran’s I for all study years. Although accounting for only 17% of the county population, nearly half of violent crime arrests were for Black or African American. Males comprised most violent crime arrests. Conclusions Crime prevention and intervention efforts should be focused on both high-risk places and offenders.

## 9. Critical Commentary: Repopulating density: COVID-19 and the politics of urban value
- **Authors:** Colin Mcfarlane
- **Journal:** Urban studies
- **Date:** 2021-06-09
- **Abstract:** How might concepts of ‘value’ and ‘population’ illuminate the present and future of urban density? The COVID-19 pandemic prompted a public debate on density in the city. While some initially blamed density for the spread of the virus, others rightly cautioned against those claims. As the pandemic progressed, an imaginary of density-as-pathology gave way to a more nuanced geographical understanding of the urban dimensions of the crisis, focused on connections, spatial conditions, domestic ‘overcrowding’ and poverty. Throughout, an interrogation and reflection on urban density and its future unfolded, throwing into question the historical relationship between ‘value’ and ‘population’ in understandings of density. I argue for a new politics of value based on shifts in three interconnected domains – governance, form and knowledge – and identify implications for research on density in urban studies.

## 10. When Crime Moves Where Does It Go? Analyzing the Spatial Correlates of Robbery Incidents Displaced by a Place-based Policing Intervention
- **Authors:** D. Hatten, Eric L. Piza
- **Journal:** Journal of research in crime and delinquency
- **Date:** 2021-05-07
- **Abstract:** Examine the place-based correlates of robbery activity displaced by a foot-patrol intervention in Newark, NJ. We use constructs from Crime Pattern and Social Disorganization theories to test hypotheses concerned with associations between the structure of the environment and the displacement of crime. Robbery incidents were spatially joined to street segments to study micro-level displacement processes. Predictor variables were operationalized using data from the Newark Police Department and Infogroup USA. Generalized Linear models tested associations between the characteristics of street segments and displaced robbery in the target area as compared to a control. Environmental structure is important to understanding the settings of displacement, though this varied between spatial and temporal displacement. Relationships between displaced crime activity and model covariates did not always appear in expected directions. For example, bus stops predicted increased spatial displacement while corner stores predicted decreased levels of temporal displacement. While testing for displacement has become commonplace in place-based policing interventions, less attention has been paid to the micro-level factors that may facilitate the displacement of crime events. Both bus stops and corner stores show consistent associations with displaced crime activity, but the directions of these relationships suggest more complex processes requiring further examination.

## 11. On urban studies in Brazil: The favela, uneven urbanisation and beyond
- **Authors:** Mariana Fix, P. Arantes
- **Journal:** Urban studies
- **Date:** 2021-03-23
- **Abstract:** This essay discusses some key ideas and debates about urban studies in Brazil, considered historiographically, from the mid-1900s to the present. It presents the main components and particularities of what emerges as the Brazilian matrix of urban studies, interrogating the most influential work in the field with the country’s own experiences of industrialisation and urbanisation. It discusses some key urban debates of the 21st century, namely new planning models associated with globalisation, global mega-events, public–private partnerships, inner-city gentrification, housing and city financialisation, rising forms of urban warfare and social control in slums (favelas), and new activisms and urban insurgencies. Through this analysis, we point to contradictions and tensions in relation to European and North American urban theory, calling for the need to formulate new categories and hypotheses to better understand the unequal and extreme processes resulting from violent expansion of capitalist relations over the entire planet, and comment on the new practices and forms of social mobilisation emerging from turbulent contexts.

## 12. The hack: What it is and why it matters to urban studies
- **Authors:** Sophia Maalsen
- **Journal:** Urban studies
- **Date:** 2021-02-23
- **Abstract:** This commentary advances the ‘hack’ as an urban concept. While the hack transcends existing literatures on the digital and informality, it is a distinctive concept and is being used systematically in new domains. I situate the hack conceptually, outline its empirical and methodological value and propose a framework to research the urban hack. Importantly, it is not just the technologies of hacking but the translation of computational logics to the urban that underpins the importance of the hack, as well as the critical need to set out a research agenda surrounding the hack within urban studies.

## 13. Small Local versus Non-Local: Examining the Relationship between Locally Owned Small Businesses and Spatial Patterns of Crime
- **Authors:** Young-An Kim, John R. Hipp
- **Journal:** Justice quarterly
- **Date:** 2021-02-19
- **Abstract:** Abstract In the current study, we theorized that businesses in place are subject to two processes: a crime generator effect in which they heighten crime due to increased opportunities and a crime inhibition effect in which certain types of businesses can increase guardianship capability. We explicitly compare the different effects of local vs. non-local and small vs. large businesses on crime in street segments using the data in cities across the Los Angeles metropolitan region by estimating a set of negative binomial regression models for small local, large local, small non-local, and large non-local consumer facing businesses (Retail, Restaurants, Food/Drug Stores, and Services) for violent and property crime. Although we found that most of the business coefficients were positive, local businesses, and particularly small local businesses, have considerably smaller crime-enhancing effects for both violent and property crime.

## 14. Thinking through people: The potential of volunteered geographic information for mobility and urban studies
- **Authors:** L. Howe
- **Journal:** Urban studies
- **Date:** 2021-01-25
- **Abstract:** Despite the ‘mobility turn’ in urban studies, there is surprisingly little research into the role people’s everyday movements play in driving urbanisation processes. As this paper discusses, one reason this has not occurred is because understanding this relationship requires both quantitative and qualitative knowledge, including geospatial locations and patterns as well as why people choose to move the way they do. Few studies employ mixed methods to this end; instead, many quantitative approaches focus on the use of big data and many qualitative approaches remain focused on sites themselves rather than the movements between them. This methodological gap can preclude operationalising findings and proves particularly detrimental when research is conducted into areas with high levels of poverty and inequality. In response, this paper presents a mixed-methods approach to studying urbanisation, using volunteered geographic information (VGI) to map regional-scale movements in the Gauteng City-Region (GCR). Exploiting the potential of smartphone technology, this methodology operates at the interstice of quantitative and qualitative research, describing both macro-scale mobility patterns and the micro-scale decisions behind them. Using the case study of the GCR, it highlights movement as a strategy for those living in poverty, who can utilise the entire region as a resource to subvert entrenched inequality. ‘Thinking through people’ suggests that a new ontology of categories describing urbanisation processes in terms of movement could connect empirical research into poverty and inequality to theory, and be used to create an epistemology of the urban from below. Thus, this paper contributes to advances in urban studies methods as well as to debates on urbanisation, relational poverty and socio-spatial inequality.

## 15. Human Mobility and Crime: Theoretical Approaches and Novel Data Collection Strategies.
- **Authors:** Christopher R. Browning, Nicolo P. Pinchak, Catherine A. Calder
- **Journal:** annual review of criminology
- **Date:** 2021-01-01
- **Abstract:** This review outlines approaches to explanations of crime that incorporate the concept of human mobility-or the patterns of movement throughout space of individuals or populations in the context of everyday routines-with a focus on novel strategies for the collection of geographically referenced data on mobility patterns. We identify three approaches to understanding mobility-crime linkages: (a) Place and neighborhood approaches characterize local spatial units of analysis of varying size with respect to the intersection in space and time of potential offenders, victims, and guardians; (b) person-centered approaches emphasize the spatial trajectories of individuals and person-place interactions that influence crime risk; and (c) ecological network approaches consider links between persons or collectivities based on shared activity locations, capturing influences of broader systems of interconnection on spatial- and individual-level variation in crime. We review data collection strategies for the measurement of mobility across these approaches, considering both the challenges and promise of mobility-based research for criminology.

## 16. Application of Participatory GIS in Crime Mapping of Ibadan North, Nigeria
- **Authors:** A. Bako, O. Aduloju, Dare J. Osewa, A. Anofi, Aisha T. Abubakar-Karma
- **Journal:** Papers in applied geography
- **Date:** 2020-12-16
- **Abstract:** Abstract This paper demonstrates the application of Participatory Geographic Information System (PGIS) as a tool to present people’s local spatial knowledge of crime in the form of 2-dimensional maps. This study adopted a survey research design employing both primary and secondary data sources. Primary data were collected through the administration of 96 copies of questionnaires, and a Web-based PGIS map served as a data collection instrument to collect spatial information on crime occurrences in the study area. Secondary data were sourced from journals, reports and the Nigerian Police Force. Results show that Mokola is a poor residential neighborhood occupied mainly by self-employed and low-income business merchants. It also reveals that Mokola experiences 689 percent more crime than would be expected, given the distribution of crime in the study area. Also, crime hotspots such as Roundabout junction, Dandaru hill, Darlington street were identified by participants aiding knowledge of the crime pattern in the study area. This study recommends natural surveillance as a concept of Crime Prevention through Environmental Design (CPTED) to keep potential offenders under easy observation. In conclusion, this study offers a vital link between the police and the general populace, one that has been absent in times past.

## 17. Spatial Patterns of Immigration and Property Crime in Vancouver: A Spatial Point Pattern Test
- **Authors:** Olivia K. Ha, Martin A. Andresen
- **Journal:** Canadian Journal of Criminology and Criminal Justice
- **Date:** 2020-10-01
- **Abstract:** Abstract:We empirically evaluate the distribution of spatial patterns at the census tract (CT) level for various immigration and property crime measures in Vancouver, British Columbia, 2003 and 2016, using a spatial point pattern test that identifies significant similarities, or otherwise, in the spatial patterns of (a) multiple measures of immigration, (b) various property crime classifications, and (c) immigration and crime patterns together. Results show local-level variations in the spatial concentration of immigration in Vancouver CTs. The use of multiple measures of immigration showed substantive variations of immigrant settlement at the local level. Moreover, results reveal that while immigrant concentration patterns are stable over time and, thus, demonstrate ecological stability, property crime patterns shift from year to year. The spatial analytic approach utilized in this study provides support for the use of local-level spatial models and the multidimensional operationalization of the immigration variable even when their correlations are high. There is heterogeneity among immigrant groups, an important yet often overlooked aspect in assessments of immigration effects on crime.Résumé:Nous évaluons de manière empirique la distribution de motifs spatiaux dans les secteur de recensement (SR) pour diverses mesures d'immigration et de crimes contre les biens à Vancouver, en Colombie-Britannique, en 2003 et 2016. Nous utilisons une analyse de second ordre de la structure spatiale de points, laquelle identifie les similitudes importantes, ou non, dans les structures spatiales de (a) de multiples mesures d'immigration, (b) diverses classifications des crimes contre les biens et (c) les motifs d'immigration et de crime mis ensemble. Les résultats montrent des variations au niveau local dans la concentration spatiale de l'immigration dans les SR de Vancouver. L'utilisation de multiples mesures d'immigration a montré d'importantes variations d'établissement des immigrants au niveau local. De plus, les résultats dévoilent que, bien que les motifs de concentration de l'immigration soient stables à travers le temps, montrant ainsi une stabilité écologique, les motifs de crimes contre les biens changent d'année en année. L'approche analytique spatiale utilisée dans cette étude soutient l'utilisation de modèles spatiaux au niveau local et l'opérationnalisation multidimensionnelle de la variable d'immigration même lorsque leurs corrélations sont élevées. Il y a une hétérogénéité parmi les groupes d'immigrants, un aspect important, même s'il est souvent ignoré, de l'évaluation des effets de l'immigration sur le crime.

## 19. Marijuana Dispensaries and Neighborhood Crime and Disorder in Denver, Colorado
- **Authors:** L. Hughes, Lonnie Schaible, K. Jimmerson
- **Journal:** Justice quarterly
- **Date:** 2020-04-15
- **Abstract:** Abstract Beginning with Colorado and Washington State in 2012, longstanding bans on the sale, possession, and use of marijuana for recreational purposes have been overturned in nine states and the nation’s capital. Consistent with the logic of routine activity theory and broken windows theory, critics of legalized marijuana argue that dispensaries are magnets for crime, attracting criminal offenders to the area with large sums of cash and valuable goods. The current study addresses this possibility by examining the effects of both medical and recreational marijuana dispensaries on yearly crime rates in N = 3981 neighborhood grid cells in Denver, Colorado, 2012–2015. Estimates from Bayesian spatiotemporal Poisson regression models indicate that, except for murder and auto theft, both types of dispensaries are associated with statistically significant increases in rates of neighborhood crime and disorder. The theoretical and policy implications of these findings are discussed.
